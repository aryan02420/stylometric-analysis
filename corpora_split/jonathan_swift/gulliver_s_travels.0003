withdrew, bidding me farewell, and saying he had left me in a good
service; to which I replied not a word, only making him a slight bow.

The queen observed my coldness; and, when the farmer was gone out of
the apartment, asked me the reason. I made bold to tell her majesty,
“that I owed no other obligation to my late master, than his not
dashing out the brains of a poor harmless creature, found by chance in
his fields: which obligation was amply recompensed, by the gain he had
made in showing me through half the kingdom, and the price he had now
sold me for. That the life I had since led was laborious enough to kill
an animal of ten times my strength. That my health was much impaired,
by the continual drudgery of entertaining the rabble every hour of the
day; and that, if my master had not thought my life in danger, her
majesty would not have got so cheap a bargain. But as I was out of all
fear of being ill-treated under the protection of so great and good an
empress, the ornament of nature, the darling of the world, the delight
of her subjects, the phœnix of the creation, so I hoped my late
master’s apprehensions would appear to be groundless; for I already
found my spirits revive, by the influence of her most august presence.”

This was the sum of my speech, delivered with great improprieties and
hesitation. The latter part was altogether framed in the style peculiar
to that people, whereof I learned some phrases from Glumdalclitch,
while she was carrying me to court.

The queen, giving great allowance for my defectiveness in speaking,
was, however, surprised at so much wit and good sense in so diminutive
an animal. She took me in her own hand, and carried me to the king, who
was then retired to his cabinet. His majesty, a prince of much gravity
and austere countenance, not well observing my shape at first view,
asked the queen after a cold manner “how long it was since she grew
fond of a _splacnuck_?” for such it seems he took me to be, as I lay
upon my breast in her majesty’s right hand. But this princess, who has
an infinite deal of wit and humour, set me gently on my feet upon the
scrutoire, and commanded me to give his majesty an account of myself,
which I did in a very few words: and Glumdalclitch who attended at the
cabinet door, and could not endure I should be out of her sight, being
admitted, confirmed all that had passed from my arrival at her father’s
house.

The king, although he be as learned a person as any in his dominions,
had been educated in the study of philosophy, and particularly
mathematics; yet when he observed my shape exactly, and saw me walk
erect, before I began to speak, conceived I might be a piece of
clock-work (which is in that country arrived to a very great
perfection) contrived by some ingenious artist. But when he heard my
voice, and found what I delivered to be regular and rational, he could
not conceal his astonishment. He was by no means satisfied with the
relation I gave him of the manner I came into his kingdom, but thought
it a story concerted between Glumdalclitch and her father, who had
taught me a set of words to make me sell at a better price. Upon this
imagination, he put several other questions to me, and still received
rational answers: no otherwise defective than by a foreign accent, and
an imperfect knowledge in the language, with some rustic phrases which
I had learned at the farmer’s house, and did not suit the polite style
of a court.

His majesty sent for three great scholars, who were then in their
weekly waiting, according to the custom in that country. These
gentlemen, after they had a while examined my shape with much nicety,
were of different opinions concerning me. They all agreed that I could
not be produced according to the regular laws of nature, because I was
not framed with a capacity of preserving my life, either by swiftness,
or climbing of trees, or digging holes in the earth. They observed by
my teeth, which they viewed with great exactness, that I was a
carnivorous animal; yet most quadrupeds being an overmatch for me, and
field mice, with some others, too nimble, they could not imagine how I
should be able to support myself, unless I fed upon snails and other
insects, which they offered, by many learned arguments, to evince that
I could not possibly do. One of these virtuosi seemed to think that I
might be an embryo, or abortive birth. But this opinion was rejected by
the other two, who observed my limbs to be perfect and finished; and
that I had lived several years, as it was manifest from my beard, the
stumps whereof they plainly discovered through a magnifying glass. They
would not allow me to be a dwarf, because my littleness was beyond all
degrees of comparison; for the queen’s favourite dwarf, the smallest
ever known in that kingdom, was near thirty feet high. After much
debate, they concluded unanimously, that I was only _relplum scalcath_,
which is interpreted literally _lusus naturæ_; a determination exactly
agreeable to the modern philosophy of Europe, whose professors,
disdaining the old evasion of occult causes, whereby the followers of
Aristotle endeavoured in vain to disguise their ignorance, have
invented this wonderful solution of all difficulties, to the
unspeakable advancement of human knowledge.

After this decisive conclusion, I entreated to be heard a word or two.
I applied myself to the king, and assured his majesty, “that I came
from a country which abounded with several millions of both sexes, and
of my own stature; where the animals, trees, and houses, were all in
proportion, and where, by consequence, I might be as able to defend
myself, and to find sustenance, as any of his majesty’s subjects could
do here; which I took for a full answer to those gentlemen’s
arguments.” To this they only replied with a smile of contempt, saying,
“that the farmer had instructed me very well in my lesson.” The king,
who had a much better understanding, dismissing his learned men, sent
for the farmer, who by good fortune was not yet gone out of town.
Having therefore first examined him privately, and then confronted him
with me and the young girl, his majesty began to think that what we
told him might possibly be true. He desired the queen to order that a
particular care should be taken of me; and was of opinion that
Glumdalclitch should still continue in her office of tending me,
because he observed we had a great affection for each other. A
convenient apartment was provided for her at court: she had a sort of
governess appointed to take care of her education, a maid to dress her,
and two other servants for menial offices; but the care of me was
wholly appropriated to herself. The queen commanded her own
cabinet-maker to contrive a box, that might serve me for a bedchamber,
after the model that Glumdalclitch and I should agree upon. This man
was a most ingenious artist, and according to my direction, in three
weeks finished for me a wooden chamber of sixteen feet square, and
twelve high, with sash-windows, a door, and two closets, like a London
bed-chamber. The board, that made the ceiling, was to be lifted up and
down by two hinges, to put in a bed ready furnished by her majesty’s
upholsterer, which Glumdalclitch took out every day to air, made it
with her own hands, and letting it down at night, locked up the roof
over me. A nice workman, who was famous for little curiosities,
undertook to make me two chairs, with backs and frames, of a substance
not unlike ivory, and two tables, with a cabinet to put my things in.
The room was quilted on all sides, as well as the floor and the
ceiling, to prevent any accident from the carelessness of those who
carried me, and to break the force of a jolt, when I went in a coach. I
desired a lock for my door, to prevent rats and mice from coming in.
The smith, after several attempts, made the smallest that ever was seen
among them, for I have known a larger at the gate of a gentleman’s
house in England. I made a shift to keep the key in a pocket of my own,
fearing Glumdalclitch might lose it. The queen likewise ordered the
thinnest silks that could be gotten, to make me clothes, not much
thicker than an English blanket, very cumbersome till I was accustomed
to them. They were after the fashion of the kingdom, partly resembling
the Persian, and partly the Chinese, and are a very grave and decent
habit.

The queen became so fond of my company, that she could not dine without
me. I had a table placed upon the same at which her majesty ate, just
at her left elbow, and a chair to sit on. Glumdalclitch stood on a
stool on the floor near my table, to assist and take care of me. I had
an entire set of silver dishes and plates, and other necessaries,
which, in proportion to those of the queen, were not much bigger than
what I have seen in a London toy-shop for the furniture of a
baby-house: these my little nurse kept in her pocket in a silver box,
and gave me at meals as I wanted them, always cleaning them herself. No
person dined with the queen but the two princesses royal, the eldest
sixteen years old, and the younger at that time thirteen and a month.
Her majesty used to put a bit of meat upon one of my dishes, out of
which I carved for myself, and her diversion was to see me eat in
miniature: for the queen (who had indeed but a weak stomach) took up,
at one mouthful, as much as a dozen English farmers could eat at a
meal, which to me was for some time a very nauseous sight. She would
craunch the wing of a lark, bones and all, between her teeth, although
it were nine times as large as that of a full-grown turkey; and put a
bit of bread into her mouth as big as two twelve-penny loaves. She
drank out of a golden cup, above a hogshead at a draught. Her knives
were twice as long as a scythe, set straight upon the handle. The
spoons, forks, and other instruments, were all in the same proportion.
I remember when Glumdalclitch carried me, out of curiosity, to see some
of the tables at court, where ten or a dozen of those enormous knives
and forks were lifted up together, I thought I had never till then
beheld so terrible a sight.

It is the custom, that every Wednesday (which, as I have observed, is
their Sabbath) the king and queen, with the royal issue of both sexes,
dine together in the apartment of his majesty, to whom I was now become
a great favourite; and at these times, my little chair and table were
placed at his left hand, before one of the salt-cellars. This prince
took a pleasure in conversing with me, inquiring into the manners,
religion, laws, government, and learning of Europe; wherein I gave him
the best account I was able. His apprehension was so clear, and his
judgment so exact, that he made very wise reflections and observations
upon all I said. But I confess, that, after I had been a little too
copious in talking of my own beloved country, of our trade and wars by
sea and land, of our schisms in religion, and parties in the state; the
prejudices of his education prevailed so far, that he could not forbear
taking me up in his right hand, and stroking me gently with the other,
after a hearty fit of laughing, asked me, “whether I was a whig or
tory?” Then turning to his first minister, who waited behind him with a
white staff, near as tall as the mainmast of the Royal Sovereign, he
observed “how contemptible a thing was human grandeur, which could be
mimicked by such diminutive insects as I: and yet,” says he, “I dare
engage these creatures have their titles and distinctions of honour;
they contrive little nests and burrows, that they call houses and
cities; they make a figure in dress and equipage; they love, they
fight, they dispute, they cheat, they betray!” And thus he continued
on, while my colour came and went several times, with indignation, to
hear our noble country, the mistress of arts and arms, the scourge of
France, the arbitress of Europe, the seat of virtue, piety, honour, and
truth, the pride and envy of the world, so contemptuously treated.

But as I was not in a condition to resent injuries, so upon mature
thoughts I began to doubt whether I was injured or no. For, after
having been accustomed several months to the sight and converse of this
people, and observed every object upon which I cast my eyes to be of
proportionable magnitude, the horror I had at first conceived from
their bulk and aspect was so far worn off, that if I had then beheld a
company of English lords and ladies in their finery and birth-day
clothes, acting their several parts in the most courtly manner of
strutting, and bowing, and prating, to say the truth, I should have
been strongly tempted to laugh as much at them as the king and his
grandees did at me. Neither, indeed, could I forbear smiling at myself,
when the queen used to place me upon her hand towards a looking-glass,
by which both our persons appeared before me in full view together; and
there could be nothing more ridiculous than the comparison; so that I
really began to imagine myself dwindled many degrees below my usual
size.

Nothing angered and mortified me so much as the queen’s dwarf; who
being of the lowest stature that was ever in that country (for I verily
think he was not full thirty feet high), became so insolent at seeing a
creature so much beneath him, that he would always affect to swagger
and look big as he passed by me in the queen’s antechamber, while I was
standing on some table talking with the lords or ladies of the court,
and he seldom failed of a smart word or two upon my littleness; against
which I could only revenge myself by calling him brother, challenging
him to wrestle, and such repartees as are usually in the mouths of
court pages. One day, at dinner, this malicious little cub was so
nettled with something I had said to him, that, raising himself upon
the frame of her majesty’s chair, he took me up by the middle, as I was
sitting down, not thinking any harm, and let me drop into a large
silver bowl of cream, and then ran away as fast as he could. I fell
over head and ears, and, if I had not been a good swimmer, it might
have gone very hard with me; for Glumdalclitch in that instant happened
to be at the other end of the room, and the queen was in such a fright,
that she wanted presence of mind to assist me. But my little nurse ran
to my relief, and took me out, after I had swallowed above a quart of
cream. I was put to bed: however, I received no other damage than the
loss of a suit of clothes, which was utterly spoiled. The dwarf was
soundly whipt, and as a farther punishment, forced to drink up the bowl
of cream into which he had thrown me: neither was he ever restored to
favour; for soon after the queen bestowed him on a lady of high
quality, so that I saw him no more, to my very great satisfaction; for
I could not tell to what extremities such a malicious urchin might have
carried his resentment.

He had before served me a scurvy trick, which set the queen a-laughing,
although at the same time she was heartily vexed, and would have
immediately cashiered him, if I had not been so generous as to
intercede. Her majesty had taken a marrow-bone upon her plate, and,
after knocking out the marrow, placed the bone again in the dish erect,
as it stood before; the dwarf, watching his opportunity, while
Glumdalclitch was gone to the side-board, mounted the stool that she
stood on to take care of me at meals, took me up in both hands, and
squeezing my legs together, wedged them into the marrow bone above my
waist, where I stuck for some time, and made a very ridiculous figure.
I believe it was near a minute before any one knew what was become of
me; for I thought it below me to cry out. But, as princes seldom get
their meat hot, my legs were not scalded, only my stockings and
breeches in a sad condition. The dwarf, at my entreaty, had no other
punishment than a sound whipping.

I was frequently rallied by the queen upon account of my fearfulness;
and she used to ask me whether the people of my country were as great
cowards as myself? The occasion was this: the kingdom is much pestered
with flies in summer; and these odious insects, each of them as big as
a Dunstable lark, hardly gave me any rest while I sat at dinner, with
their continual humming and buzzing about mine ears. They would
sometimes alight upon my victuals, and leave their loathsome excrement,
or spawn behind, which to me was very visible, though not to the
natives of that country, whose large optics were not so acute as mine,
in viewing smaller objects. Sometimes they would fix upon my nose, or
forehead, where they stung me to the quick, smelling very offensively;
and I could easily trace that viscous matter, which, our naturalists
tell us, enables those creatures to walk with their feet upwards upon a
ceiling. I had much ado to defend myself against these detestable
animals, and could not forbear starting when they came on my face. It
was the common practice of the dwarf, to catch a number of these
insects in his hand, as schoolboys do among us, and let them out
suddenly under my nose, on purpose to frighten me, and divert the
queen. My remedy was to cut them in pieces with my knife, as they flew
in the air, wherein my dexterity was much admired.

I remember, one morning, when Glumdalclitch had set me in a box upon a
window, as she usually did in fair days to give me air (for I durst not
venture to let the box be hung on a nail out of the window, as we do
with cages in England), after I had lifted up one of my sashes, and sat
down at my table to eat a piece of sweet cake for my breakfast, above
twenty wasps, allured by the smell, came flying into the room, humming
louder than the drones of as many bagpipes. Some of them seized my
cake, and carried it piecemeal away; others flew about my head and
face, confounding me with the noise, and putting me in the utmost
terror of their stings. However, I had the courage to rise and draw my
hanger, and attack them in the air. I dispatched four of them, but the
rest got away, and I presently shut my window. These insects were as
large as partridges: I took out their stings, found them an inch and a
half long, and as sharp as needles. I carefully preserved them all; and
having since shown them, with some other curiosities, in several parts
of Europe, upon my return to England I gave three of them to Gresham
College, and kept the fourth for myself.


CHAPTER IV.

The country described. A proposal for correcting modern maps. The
king’s palace; and some account of the metropolis. The author’s way of
travelling. The chief temple described.


I now intend to give the reader a short description of this country, as
far as I travelled in it, which was not above two thousand miles round
Lorbrulgrud, the metropolis. For the queen, whom I always attended,
never went farther when she accompanied the king in his progresses, and
there staid till his majesty returned from viewing his frontiers. The
whole extent of this prince’s dominions reaches about six thousand
miles in length, and from three to five in breadth: whence I cannot but
conclude, that our geographers of Europe are in a great error, by
supposing nothing but sea between Japan and California; for it was ever
my opinion, that there must be a balance of earth to counterpoise the
great continent of Tartary; and therefore they ought to correct their
maps and charts, by joining this vast tract of land to the north-west
parts of America, wherein I shall be ready to lend them my assistance.

The kingdom is a peninsula, terminated to the north-east by a ridge of
mountains thirty miles high, which are altogether impassable, by reason
of the volcanoes upon the tops: neither do the most learned know what
sort of mortals inhabit beyond those mountains, or whether they be
inhabited at all. On the three other sides, it is bounded by the ocean.
There is not one seaport in the whole kingdom: and those parts of the
coasts into which the rivers issue, are so full of pointed rocks, and
the sea generally so rough, that there is no venturing with the
smallest of their boats; so that these people are wholly excluded from
any commerce with the rest of the world. But the large rivers are full
of vessels, and abound with excellent fish; for they seldom get any
from the sea, because the sea fish are of the same size with those in
Europe, and consequently not worth catching; whereby it is manifest,
that nature, in the production of plants and animals of so
extraordinary a bulk, is wholly confined to this continent, of which I
leave the reasons to be determined by philosophers. However, now and
then they take a whale that happens to be dashed against the rocks,
which the common people feed on heartily. These whales I have known so
large, that a man could hardly carry one upon his shoulders; and
sometimes, for curiosity, they are brought in hampers to Lorbrulgrud; I
saw one of them in a dish at the king’s table, which passed for a
rarity, but I did not observe he was fond of it; for I think, indeed,
the bigness disgusted him, although I have seen one somewhat larger in
Greenland.

The country is well inhabited, for it contains fifty-one cities, near a
hundred walled towns, and a great number of villages. To satisfy my
curious reader, it may be sufficient to describe Lorbrulgrud. This city
stands upon almost two equal parts, on each side the river that passes
through. It contains above eighty thousand houses, and about six
hundred thousand inhabitants. It is in length three _glomglungs_ (which
make about fifty-four English miles,) and two and a half in breadth; as
I measured it myself in the royal map made by the king’s order, which
was laid on the ground on purpose for me, and extended a hundred feet:
I paced the diameter and circumference several times barefoot, and,
computing by the scale, measured it pretty exactly.

The king’s palace is no regular edifice, but a heap of buildings, about
seven miles round: the chief rooms are generally two hundred and forty
feet high, and broad and long in proportion. A coach was allowed to
Glumdalclitch and me, wherein her governess frequently took her out to
see the town, or go among the shops; and I was always of the party,
carried in my box; although the girl, at my own desire, would often
take me out, and hold me in her hand, that I might more conveniently
view the houses and the people, as we passed along the streets. I
reckoned our coach to be about a square of Westminster-hall, but not
altogether so high: however, I cannot be very exact. One day the
governess ordered our coachman to stop at several shops, where the
beggars, watching their opportunity, crowded to the sides of the coach,
and gave me the most horrible spectacle that ever a European eye
beheld. There was a woman with a cancer in her breast, swelled to a
monstrous size, full of holes, in two or three of which I could have
easily crept, and covered my whole body. There was a fellow with a wen
in his neck, larger than five wool-packs; and another, with a couple of
wooden legs, each about twenty feet high. But the most hateful sight of
all, was the lice crawling on their clothes. I could see distinctly the
limbs of these vermin with my naked eye, much better than those of a
European louse through a microscope, and their snouts with which they
rooted like swine. They were the first I had ever beheld, and I should
have been curious enough to dissect one of them, if I had had proper
instruments, which I unluckily left behind me in the ship, although,
indeed, the sight was so nauseous, that it perfectly turned my stomach.

Besides the large box in which I was usually carried, the queen ordered
a smaller one to be made for me, of about twelve feet square, and ten
high, for the convenience of travelling; because the other was somewhat
too large for Glumdalclitch’s lap, and cumbersome in the coach; it was
made by the same artist, whom I directed in the whole contrivance. This
travelling-closet was an exact square, with a window in the middle of
three of the squares, and each window was latticed with iron wire on
the outside, to prevent accidents in long journeys. On the fourth side,
which had no window, two strong staples were fixed, through which the
person that carried me, when I had a mind to be on horseback, put a
leathern belt, and buckled it about his waist. This was always the
office of some grave trusty servant, in whom I could confide, whether I
attended the king and queen in their progresses, or were disposed to
see the gardens, or pay a visit to some great lady or minister of state
in the court, when Glumdalclitch happened to be out of order; for I
soon began to be known and esteemed among the greatest officers, I
suppose more upon account of their majesties’ favour, than any merit of
my own. In journeys, when I was weary of the coach, a servant on
horseback would buckle on my box, and place it upon a cushion before
him; and there I had a full prospect of the country on three sides,
from my three windows. I had, in this closet, a field-bed and a
hammock, hung from the ceiling, two chairs and a table, neatly screwed
to the floor, to prevent being tossed about by the agitation of the
horse or the coach. And having been long used to sea-voyages, those
motions, although sometimes very violent, did not much discompose me.

Whenever I had a mind to see the town, it was always in my
travelling-closet; which Glumdalclitch held in her lap in a kind of
open sedan, after the fashion of the country, borne by four men, and
attended by two others in the queen’s livery. The people, who had often
heard of me, were very curious to crowd about the sedan, and the girl
was complaisant enough to make the bearers stop, and to take me in her
hand, that I might be more conveniently seen.

I was very desirous to see the chief temple, and particularly the tower
belonging to it, which is reckoned the highest in the kingdom.
Accordingly one day my nurse carried me thither, but I may truly say I
came back disappointed; for the height is not above three thousand
feet, reckoning from the ground to the highest pinnacle top; which,
allowing for the difference between the size of those people and us in
Europe, is no great matter for admiration, nor at all equal in
proportion (if I rightly remember) to Salisbury steeple. But, not to
detract from a nation, to which, during my life, I shall acknowledge
myself extremely obliged, it must be allowed, that whatever this famous
tower wants in height, is amply made up in beauty and strength: for the
walls are near a hundred feet thick, built of hewn stone, whereof each
is about forty feet square, and adorned on all sides with statues of
gods and emperors, cut in marble, larger than the life, placed in their
several niches. I measured a little finger which had fallen down from
one of these statues, and lay unperceived among some rubbish, and found
it exactly four feet and an inch in length. Glumdalclitch wrapped it up
in her handkerchief, and carried it home in her pocket, to keep among
other trinkets, of which the girl was very fond, as children at her age
usually are.

The king’s kitchen is indeed a noble building, vaulted at top, and
about six hundred feet high. The great oven is not so wide, by ten
paces, as the cupola at St. Paul’s: for I measured the latter on
purpose, after my return. But if I should describe the kitchen grate,
the prodigious pots and kettles, the joints of meat turning on the
spits, with many other particulars, perhaps I should be hardly
believed; at least a severe critic would be apt to think I enlarged a
little, as travellers are often suspected to do. To avoid which censure
I fear I have run too much into the other extreme; and that if this
treatise should happen to be translated into the language of
Brobdingnag (which is the general name of that kingdom,) and
transmitted thither, the king and his people would have reason to
complain that I had done them an injury, by a false and diminutive
representation.

His majesty seldom keeps above six hundred horses in his stables: they
are generally from fifty-four to sixty feet high. But, when he goes
abroad on solemn days, he is attended, for state, by a military guard
of five hundred horse, which, indeed, I thought was the most splendid
sight that could be ever beheld, till I saw part of his army in
battalia, whereof I shall find another occasion to speak.


CHAPTER V.

Several adventures that happened to the author. The execution of a
criminal. The author shows his skill in navigation.


I should have lived happy enough in that country, if my littleness had
not exposed me to several ridiculous and troublesome accidents; some of
which I shall venture to relate. Glumdalclitch often carried me into
the gardens of the court in my smaller box, and would sometimes take me
out of it, and hold me in her hand, or set me down to walk. I remember,
before the dwarf left the queen, he followed us one day into those
gardens, and my nurse having set me down, he and I being close
together, near some dwarf apple trees, I must needs show my wit, by a
silly allusion between him and the trees, which happens to hold in
their language as it does in ours. Whereupon, the malicious rogue,
watching his opportunity, when I was walking under one of them, shook
it directly over my head, by which a dozen apples, each of them near as
large as a Bristol barrel, came tumbling about my ears; one of them hit
me on the back as I chanced to stoop, and knocked me down flat on my
face; but I received no other hurt, and the dwarf was pardoned at my
desire, because I had given the provocation.

Another day, Glumdalclitch left me on a smooth grass-plot to divert
myself, while she walked at some distance with her governess. In the
meantime, there suddenly fell such a violent shower of hail, that I was
immediately by the force of it, struck to the ground: and when I was
down, the hailstones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body, as if
I had been pelted with tennis-balls; however, I made a shift to creep
on all fours, and shelter myself, by lying flat on my face, on the
lee-side of a border of lemon-thyme, but so bruised from head to foot,
that I could not go abroad in ten days. Neither is this at all to be
wondered at, because nature, in that country, observing the same
proportion through all her operations, a hailstone is near eighteen
hundred times as large as one in Europe; which I can assert upon
experience, having been so curious as to weigh and measure them.

But a more dangerous accident happened to me in the same garden, when
my little nurse, believing she had put me in a secure place (which I
often entreated her to do, that I might enjoy my own thoughts,) and
having left my box at home, to avoid the trouble of carrying it, went
to another part of the garden with her governess and some ladies of her
acquaintance. While she was absent, and out of hearing, a small white
spaniel that belonged to one of the chief gardeners, having got by
accident into the garden, happened to range near the place where I lay:
the dog, following the scent, came directly up, and taking me in his
mouth, ran straight to his master wagging his tail, and set me gently
on the ground. By good fortune he had been so well taught, that I was
carried between his teeth without the least hurt, or even tearing my
clothes. But the poor gardener, who knew me well, and had a great
kindness for me, was in a terrible fright: he gently took me up in both
his hands, and asked me how I did? but I was so amazed and out of
breath, that I could not speak a word. In a few minutes I came to
myself, and he carried me safe to my little nurse, who, by this time,
had returned to the place where she left me, and was in cruel agonies
when I did not appear, nor answer when she called. She severely
reprimanded the gardener on account of his dog. But the thing was
hushed up, and never known at court, for the girl was afraid of the
queen’s anger; and truly, as to myself, I thought it would not be for
my reputation, that such a story should go about.

This accident absolutely determined Glumdalclitch never to trust me
abroad for the future out of her sight. I had been long afraid of this
resolution, and therefore concealed from her some little unlucky
adventures, that happened in those times when I was left by myself.
Once a kite, hovering over the garden, made a stoop at me, and if I had
not resolutely drawn my hanger, and run under a thick espalier, he
would have certainly carried me away in his talons. Another time,
walking to the top of a fresh mole-hill, I fell to my neck in the hole,
through which that animal had cast up the earth, and coined some lie,
not worth remembering, to excuse myself for spoiling my clothes. I
likewise broke my right shin against the shell of a snail, which I
happened to stumble over, as I was walking alone and thinking on poor
England.

I cannot tell whether I were more pleased or mortified to observe, in
those solitary walks, that the smaller birds did not appear to be at
all afraid of me, but would hop about within a yard’s distance, looking
for worms and other food, with as much indifference and security as if
no creature at all were near them. I remember, a thrush had the
confidence to snatch out of my hand, with his bill, a piece of cake
that Glumdalclitch had just given me for my breakfast. When I attempted
to catch any of these birds, they would boldly turn against me,
endeavouring to peck my fingers, which I durst not venture within their
reach; and then they would hop back unconcerned, to hunt for worms or
snails, as they did before. But one day, I took a thick cudgel, and
threw it with all my strength so luckily, at a linnet, that I knocked
him down, and seizing him by the neck with both my hands, ran with him
in triumph to my nurse. However, the bird, who had only been stunned,
recovering himself gave me so many boxes with his wings, on both sides
of my head and body, though I held him at arm’s length, and was out of
the reach of his claws, that I was twenty times thinking to let him go.
But I was soon relieved by one of our servants, who wrung off the
bird’s neck, and I had him next day for dinner, by the queen’s command.
This linnet, as near as I can remember, seemed to be somewhat larger
than an English swan.

The maids of honour often invited Glumdalclitch to their apartments,
and desired she would bring me along with her, on purpose to have the
pleasure of seeing and touching me. They would often strip me naked
from top to toe, and lay me at full length in their bosoms; wherewith I
was much disgusted because, to say the truth, a very offensive smell
came from their skins; which I do not mention, or intend, to the
disadvantage of those excellent ladies, for whom I have all manner of
respect; but I conceive that my sense was more acute in proportion to
my littleness, and that those illustrious persons were no more
disagreeable to their lovers, or to each other, than people of the same
quality are with us in England. And, after all, I found their natural
smell was much more supportable, than when they used perfumes, under
which I immediately swooned away. I cannot forget, that an intimate
friend of mine in Lilliput, took the freedom in a warm day, when I had
used a good deal of exercise, to complain of a strong smell about me,
although I am as little faulty that way, as most of my sex: but I
suppose his faculty of smelling was as nice with regard to me, as mine
was to that of this people. Upon this point, I cannot forbear doing
justice to the queen my mistress, and Glumdalclitch my nurse, whose
persons were as sweet as those of any lady in England.

That which gave me most uneasiness among these maids of honour (when my
nurse carried me to visit them) was, to see them use me without any
manner of ceremony, like a creature who had no sort of consequence: for
they would strip themselves to the skin, and put on their smocks in my
presence, while I was placed on their toilet, directly before their
naked bodies, which I am sure to me was very far from being a tempting
sight, or from giving me any other emotions than those of horror and
disgust: their skins appeared so coarse and uneven, so variously
coloured, when I saw them near, with a mole here and there as broad as
a trencher, and hairs hanging from it thicker than packthreads, to say
nothing farther concerning the rest of their persons. Neither did they
at all scruple, while I was by, to discharge what they had drank, to
the quantity of at least two hogsheads, in a vessel that held above
three tuns. The handsomest among these maids of honour, a pleasant,
frolicsome girl of sixteen, would sometimes set me astride upon one of
her nipples, with many other tricks, wherein the reader will excuse me
for not being over particular. But I was so much displeased, that I
entreated Glumdalclitch to contrive some excuse for not seeing that
young lady any more.

One day, a young gentleman, who was nephew to my nurse’s governess,
came and pressed them both to see an execution. It was of a man, who
had murdered one of that gentleman’s intimate acquaintance.
Glumdalclitch was prevailed on to be of the company, very much against
her inclination, for she was naturally tender-hearted: and, as for
myself, although I abhorred such kind of spectacles, yet my curiosity
tempted me to see something that I thought must be extraordinary. The
malefactor was fixed in a chair upon a scaffold erected for that
purpose, and his head cut off at one blow, with a sword of about forty
feet long. The veins and arteries spouted up such a prodigious quantity
of blood, and so high in the air, that the great _jet d’eau_ at
Versailles was not equal to it for the time it lasted: and the head,
when it fell on the scaffold floor, gave such a bounce as made me
start, although I was at least half an English mile distant.

The queen, who often used to hear me talk of my sea-voyages, and took
all occasions to divert me when I was melancholy, asked me whether I
understood how to handle a sail or an oar, and whether a little
exercise of rowing might not be convenient for my health? I answered,
that I understood both very well: for although my proper employment had
been to be surgeon or doctor to the ship, yet often, upon a pinch, I
was forced to work like a common mariner. But I could not see how this
could be done in their country, where the smallest wherry was equal to
a first-rate man of war among us; and such a boat as I could manage
would never live in any of their rivers. Her majesty said, if I would
contrive a boat, her own joiner should make it, and she would provide a
place for me to sail in. The fellow was an ingenious workman, and by my
instructions, in ten days, finished a pleasure-boat with all its
tackling, able conveniently to hold eight Europeans. When it was
finished, the queen was so delighted, that she ran with it in her lap
to the king, who ordered it to be put into a cistern full of water,
with me in it, by way of trial, where I could not manage my two sculls,
or little oars, for want of room. But the queen had before contrived
another project. She ordered the joiner to make a wooden trough of
three hundred feet long, fifty broad, and eight deep; which, being well
pitched, to prevent leaking, was placed on the floor, along the wall,
in an outer room of the palace. It had a cock near the bottom to let
out the water, when it began to grow stale; and two servants could
easily fill it in half an hour. Here I often used to row for my own
diversion, as well as that of the queen and her ladies, who thought
themselves well entertained with my skill and agility. Sometimes I
would put up my sail, and then my business was only to steer, while the
ladies gave me a gale with their fans; and, when they were weary, some
of their pages would blow my sail forward with their breath, while I
showed my art by steering starboard or larboard as I pleased. When I
had done, Glumdalclitch always carried back my boat into her closet,
and hung it on a nail to dry.

In this exercise I once met an accident, which had like to have cost me
my life; for, one of the pages having put my boat into the trough, the
governess who attended Glumdalclitch very officiously lifted me up, to
place me in the boat: but I happened to slip through her fingers, and
should infallibly have fallen down forty feet upon the floor, if, by
the luckiest chance in the world, I had not been stopped by a
corking-pin that stuck in the good gentlewoman’s stomacher; the head of
the pin passing between my shirt and the waistband of my breeches, and
thus I was held by the middle in the air, till Glumdalclitch ran to my
relief.

Another time, one of the servants, whose office it was to fill my
trough every third day with fresh water, was so careless as to let a
huge frog (not perceiving it) slip out of his pail. The frog lay
concealed till I was put into my boat, but then, seeing a
resting-place, climbed up, and made it lean so much on one side, that I
was forced to balance it with all my weight on the other, to prevent
overturning. When the frog was got in, it hopped at once half the
length of the boat, and then over my head, backward and forward,
daubing my face and clothes with its odious slime. The largeness of its
features made it appear the most deformed animal that can be conceived.
However, I desired Glumdalclitch to let me deal with it alone. I banged
it a good while with one of my sculls, and at last forced it to leap
out of the boat.

But the greatest danger I ever underwent in that kingdom, was from a
monkey, who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen. Glumdalclitch
had locked me up in her closet, while she went somewhere upon business,
or a visit. The weather being very warm, the closet-window was left
open, as well as the windows and the door of my bigger box, in which I
usually lived, because of its largeness and conveniency. As I sat
quietly meditating at my table, I heard something bounce in at the
closet-window, and skip about from one side to the other: whereat,
although I was much alarmed, yet I ventured to look out, but not
stirring from my seat; and then I saw this frolicsome animal frisking
and leaping up and down, till at last he came to my box, which he
seemed to view with great pleasure and curiosity, peeping in at the
door and every window. I retreated to the farther corner of my room; or
box; but the monkey looking in at every side, put me in such a fright,
that I wanted presence of mind to conceal myself under the bed, as I
might easily have done. After some time spent in peeping, grinning, and
chattering, he at last espied me; and reaching one of his paws in at
the door, as a cat does when she plays with a mouse, although I often
shifted place to avoid him, he at length seized the lappet of my coat
(which being made of that country silk, was very thick and strong), and
dragged me out. He took me up in his right fore-foot and held me as a
nurse does a child she is going to suckle, just as I have seen the same
sort of creature do with a kitten in Europe; and when I offered to
struggle he squeezed me so hard, that I thought it more prudent to
submit. I have good reason to believe, that he took me for a young one
of his own species, by his often stroking my face very gently with his
other paw. In these diversions he was interrupted by a noise at the
closet door, as if somebody were opening it: whereupon he suddenly
leaped up to the window at which he had come in, and thence upon the
leads and gutters, walking upon three legs, and holding me in the
fourth, till he clambered up to a roof that was next to ours. I heard
Glumdalclitch give a shriek at the moment he was carrying me out. The
poor girl was almost distracted: that quarter of the palace was all in
an uproar; the servants ran for ladders; the monkey was seen by
hundreds in the court, sitting upon the ridge of a building, holding me
like a baby in one of his forepaws, and feeding me with the other, by
cramming into my mouth some victuals he had squeezed out of the bag on
one side of his chaps, and patting me when I would not eat; whereat
many of the rabble below could not forbear laughing; neither do I think
they justly ought to be blamed, for, without question, the sight was
ridiculous enough to every body but myself. Some of the people threw up
stones, hoping to drive the monkey down; but this was strictly
forbidden, or else, very probably, my brains had been dashed out.

The ladders were now applied, and mounted by several men; which the
monkey observing, and finding himself almost encompassed, not being
able to make speed enough with his three legs, let me drop on a ridge
tile, and made his escape. Here I sat for some time, five hundred yards
from the ground, expecting every moment to be blown down by the wind,
or to fall by my own giddiness, and come tumbling over and over from
the ridge to the eaves; but an honest lad, one of my nurse’s footmen,
climbed up, and putting me into his breeches pocket, brought me down
safe.

I was almost choked with the filthy stuff the monkey had crammed down
my throat: but my dear little nurse picked it out of my mouth with a
small needle, and then I fell a-vomiting, which gave me great relief.
Yet I was so weak and bruised in the sides with the squeezes given me
by this odious animal, that I was forced to keep my bed a fortnight.
The king, queen, and all the court, sent every day to inquire after my
health; and her majesty made me several visits during my sickness. The
monkey was killed, and an order made, that no such animal should be
kept about the palace.

When I attended the king after my recovery, to return him thanks for
his favours, he was pleased to rally me a good deal upon this
adventure. He asked me, “what my thoughts and speculations were, while
I lay in the monkey’s paw; how I liked the victuals he gave me; his
manner of feeding; and whether the fresh air on the roof had sharpened
my stomach.” He desired to know, “what I would have done upon such an
occasion in my own country.” I told his majesty, “that in Europe we had
no monkeys, except such as were brought for curiosity from other
places, and so small, that I could deal with a dozen of them together,
if they presumed to attack me. And as for that monstrous animal with
whom I was so lately engaged (it was indeed as large as an elephant),
if my fears had suffered me to think so far as to make use of my
hanger,” (looking fiercely, and clapping my hand on the hilt, as I
spoke) “when he poked his paw into my chamber, perhaps I should have
given him such a wound, as would have made him glad to withdraw it with
more haste than he put it in.” This I delivered in a firm tone, like a
person who was jealous lest his courage should be called in question.
However, my speech produced nothing else beside a loud laughter, which
all the respect due to his majesty from those about him could not make
them contain. This made me reflect, how vain an attempt it is for a man
to endeavour to do himself honour among those who are out of all degree
of equality or comparison with him. And yet I have seen the moral of my
own behaviour very frequent in England since my return; where a little
contemptible varlet, without the least title to birth, person, wit, or
common sense, shall presume to look with importance, and put himself
upon a foot with the greatest persons of the kingdom.

I was every day furnishing the court with some ridiculous story: and
Glumdalclitch, although she loved me to excess, yet was arch enough to
inform the queen, whenever I committed any folly that she thought would
be diverting to her majesty. The girl, who had been out of order, was
carried by her governess to take the air about an hour’s distance, or
thirty miles from town. They alighted out of the coach near a small
foot-path in a field, and Glumdalclitch setting down my travelling box,
I went out of it to walk. There was a cow-dung in the path, and I must
need try my activity by attempting to leap over it. I took a run, but
unfortunately jumped short, and found myself just in the middle up to
my knees. I waded through with some difficulty, and one of the footmen
wiped me as clean as he could with his handkerchief, for I was filthily
bemired; and my nurse confined me to my box, till we returned home;
where the queen was soon informed of what had passed, and the footmen
spread it about the court: so that all the mirth for some days was at
my expense.


CHAPTER VI.

Several contrivances of the author to please the king and queen. He
shows his skill in music. The king inquires into the state of England,
which the author relates to him. The king’s observations thereon.


I used to attend the king’s levee once or twice a week, and had often
seen him under the barber’s hand, which indeed was at first very
terrible to behold; for the razor was almost twice as long as an
ordinary scythe. His majesty, according to the custom of the country,
was only shaved twice a week. I once prevailed on the barber to give me
some of the suds or lather, out of which I picked forty or fifty of the
strongest stumps of hair. I then took a piece of fine wood, and cut it
like the back of a comb, making several holes in it at equal distances
with as small a needle as I could get from Glumdalclitch. I fixed in
the stumps so artificially, scraping and sloping them with my knife
toward the points, that I made a very tolerable comb; which was a
seasonable supply, my own being so much broken in the teeth, that it
was almost useless: neither did I know any artist in that country so
nice and exact, as would undertake to make me another.

And this puts me in mind of an amusement, wherein I spent many of my
leisure hours. I desired the queen’s woman to save for me the combings
of her majesty’s hair, whereof in time I got a good quantity; and
consulting with my friend the cabinet-maker, who had received general
orders to do little jobs for me, I directed him to make two
chair-frames, no larger than those I had in my box, and to bore little
holes with a fine awl, round those parts where I designed the backs and
seats; through these holes I wove the strongest hairs I could pick out,
just after the manner of cane chairs in England. When they were
finished, I made a present of them to her majesty; who kept them in her
cabinet, and used to show them for curiosities, as indeed they were the
wonder of every one that beheld them. The queen would have me sit upon
one of these chairs, but I absolutely refused to obey her, protesting I
would rather die than place a dishonourable part of my body on those
precious hairs, that once adorned her majesty’s head. Of these hairs
(as I had always a mechanical genius) I likewise made a neat little
purse, about five feet long, with her majesty’s name deciphered in gold
letters, which I gave to Glumdalclitch, by the queen’s consent. To say
the truth, it was more for show than use, being not of strength to bear
the weight of the larger coins, and therefore she kept nothing in it
but some little toys that girls are fond of.

The king, who delighted in music, had frequent concerts at court, to
which I was sometimes carried, and set in my box on a table to hear
them: but the noise was so great that I could hardly distinguish the
tunes. I am confident that all the drums and trumpets of a royal army,
beating and sounding together just at your ears, could not equal it. My
practice was to have my box removed from the place where the performers
sat, as far as I could, then to shut the doors and windows of it, and
draw the window curtains; after which I found their music not
disagreeable.

I had learned in my youth to play a little upon the spinet.
Glumdalclitch kept one in her chamber, and a master attended twice a
week to teach her: I called it a spinet, because it somewhat resembled
that instrument, and was played upon in the same manner. A fancy came
into my head, that I would entertain the king and queen with an English
tune upon this instrument. But this appeared extremely difficult: for
the spinet was near sixty feet long, each key being almost a foot wide,
so that with my arms extended I could not reach to above five keys, and
to press them down required a good smart stroke with my fist, which
would be too great a labour, and to no purpose. The method I contrived
was this: I prepared two round sticks, about the bigness of common
cudgels; they were thicker at one end than the other, and I covered the
thicker ends with pieces of a mouse’s skin, that by rapping on them I
might neither damage the tops of the keys nor interrupt the sound.
Before the spinet a bench was placed, about four feet below the keys,
and I was put upon the bench. I ran sideling upon it, that way and
this, as fast as I could, banging the proper keys with my two sticks,
and made a shift to play a jig, to the great satisfaction of both their
majesties; but it was the most violent exercise I ever underwent; and
yet I could not strike above sixteen keys, nor consequently play the
bass and treble together, as other artists do; which was a great
disadvantage to my performance.

The king, who, as I before observed, was a prince of excellent
understanding, would frequently order that I should be brought in my
box, and set upon the table in his closet: he would then command me to
bring one of my chairs out of the box, and sit down within three yards
distance upon the top of the cabinet, which brought me almost to a
level with his face. In this manner I had several conversations with
him. I one day took the freedom to tell his majesty, “that the contempt
he discovered towards Europe, and the rest of the world, did not seem
answerable to those excellent qualities of mind that he was master of;
that reason did not extend itself with the bulk of the body; on the
contrary, we observed in our country, that the tallest persons were
usually the least provided with it; that among other animals, bees and
ants had the reputation of more industry, art, and sagacity, than many
of the larger kinds; and that, as inconsiderable as he took me to be, I
hoped I might live to do his majesty some signal service.” The king
heard me with attention, and began to conceive a much better opinion of
me than he had ever before. He desired “I would give him as exact an
account of the government of England as I possibly could; because, as
fond as princes commonly are of their own customs (for so he
conjectured of other monarchs, by my former discourses), he should be
glad to hear of any thing that might deserve imitation.”

Imagine with thyself, courteous reader, how often I then wished for the
tongue of Demosthenes or Cicero, that might have enabled me to
celebrate the praise of my own dear native country in a style equal to
its merits and felicity.

I began my discourse by informing his majesty, that our dominions
consisted of two islands, which composed three mighty kingdoms, under
one sovereign, beside our plantations in America. I dwelt long upon the
fertility of our soil, and the temperature of our climate. I then spoke
at large upon the constitution of an English parliament; partly made up
of an illustrious body called the House of Peers; persons of the
noblest blood, and of the most ancient and ample patrimonies. I
described that extraordinary care always taken of their education in
arts and arms, to qualify them for being counsellors both to the king
and kingdom; to have a share in the legislature; to be members of the
highest court of judicature, whence there can be no appeal; and to be
champions always ready for the defence of their prince and country, by
their valour, conduct, and fidelity. That these were the ornament and
bulwark of the kingdom, worthy followers of their most renowned
ancestors, whose honour had been the reward of their virtue, from which
their posterity were never once known to degenerate. To these were
joined several holy persons, as part of that assembly, under the title
of bishops, whose peculiar business is to take care of religion, and of
those who instruct the people therein. These were searched and sought
out through the whole nation, by the prince and his wisest counsellors,
among such of the priesthood as were most deservedly distinguished by
the sanctity of their lives, and the depth of their erudition; who were
indeed the spiritual fathers of the clergy and the people.

That the other part of the parliament consisted of an assembly called
the House of Commons, who were all principal gentlemen, freely picked
and culled out by the people themselves, for their great abilities and
love of their country, to represent the wisdom of the whole nation. And
that these two bodies made up the most august assembly in Europe; to
whom, in conjunction with the prince, the whole legislature is
committed.

I then descended to the courts of justice; over which the judges, those
venerable sages and interpreters of the law, presided, for determining
the disputed rights and properties of men, as well as for the
punishment of vice and protection of innocence. I mentioned the prudent
management of our treasury; the valour and achievements of our forces,
by sea and land. I computed the number of our people, by reckoning how
many millions there might be of each religious sect, or political party
among us. I did not omit even our sports and pastimes, or any other
particular which I thought might redound to the honour of my country.
And I finished all with a brief historical account of affairs and
events in England for about a hundred years past.

This conversation was not ended under five audiences, each of several
hours; and the king heard the whole with great attention, frequently
taking notes of what I spoke, as well as memorandums of what questions
he intended to ask me.

When I had put an end to these long discourses, his majesty, in a sixth
audience, consulting his notes, proposed many doubts, queries, and
objections, upon every article. He asked, “What methods were used to
cultivate the minds and bodies of our young nobility, and in what kind
of business they commonly spent the first and teachable parts of their
lives? What course was taken to supply that assembly, when any noble
family became extinct? What qualifications were necessary in those who
are to be created new lords: whether the humour of the prince, a sum of
money to a court lady, or a design of strengthening a party opposite to
the public interest, ever happened to be the motive in those
advancements? What share of knowledge these lords had in the laws of
their country, and how they came by it, so as to enable them to decide
the properties of their fellow-subjects in the last resort? Whether
they were always so free from avarice, partialities, or want, that a
bribe, or some other sinister view, could have no place among them?
Whether those holy lords I spoke of were always promoted to that rank
upon account of their knowledge in religious matters, and the sanctity
of their lives; had never been compliers with the times, while they
were common priests; or slavish prostitute chaplains to some nobleman,
whose opinions they continued servilely to follow, after they were
admitted into that assembly?”

He then desired to know, “What arts were practised in electing those
whom I called commoners: whether a stranger, with a strong purse, might
not influence the vulgar voters to choose him before their own
landlord, or the most considerable gentleman in the neighbourhood? How
it came to pass, that people were so violently bent upon getting into
this assembly, which I allowed to be a great trouble and expense, often
to the ruin of their families, without any salary or pension? because
this appeared such an exalted strain of virtue and public spirit, that
his majesty seemed to doubt it might possibly not be always sincere.”
And he desired to know, “Whether such zealous gentlemen could have any
views of refunding themselves for the charges and trouble they were at
by sacrificing the public good to the designs of a weak and vicious
prince, in conjunction with a corrupted ministry?” He multiplied his
questions, and sifted me thoroughly upon every part of this head,
proposing numberless inquiries and objections, which I think it not
prudent or convenient to repeat.

Upon what I said in relation to our courts of justice, his majesty
desired to be satisfied in several points: and this I was the better
able to do, having been formerly almost ruined by a long suit in
chancery, which was decreed for me with costs. He asked, “What time was
usually spent in determining between right and wrong, and what degree
of expense? Whether advocates and orators had liberty to plead in
causes manifestly known to be unjust, vexatious, or oppressive? Whether
party, in religion or politics, were observed to be of any weight in
the scale of justice? Whether those pleading orators were persons
educated in the general knowledge of equity, or only in provincial,
national, and other local customs? Whether they or their judges had any
part in penning those laws, which they assumed the liberty of
interpreting, and glossing upon at their pleasure? Whether they had
ever, at different times, pleaded for and against the same cause, and
cited precedents to prove contrary opinions? Whether they were a rich
or a poor corporation? Whether they received any pecuniary reward for
pleading, or delivering their opinions? And particularly, whether they
were ever admitted as members in the lower senate?”

He fell next upon the management of our treasury; and said, “he thought
my memory had failed me, because I computed our taxes at about five or
six millions a year, and when I came to mention the issues, he found
they sometimes amounted to more than double; for the notes he had taken
were very particular in this point, because he hoped, as he told me,
that the knowledge of our conduct might be useful to him, and he could
