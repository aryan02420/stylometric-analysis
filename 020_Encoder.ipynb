    "Language models need to make use of the sequential nature of words in a sentence. Since the Transformer model contains no recurrent or convolutional units, positional encodings (PEs) are used to account for the order of the words in the input sequence. The positional encodings have the same dimension, d<sub>model</sub>, as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed (see Figure 4). This allows the model to understand the position of each word in the input text.\n",

Now, the first PE (positional encoding) for the first dimension, <i>k</i> = 0, of the embedding vector will be sin(0/10000<sup>0/4</sup>), and the second PE for the second dimension, k = 1, will be cos(0/10000<sup>0/4</sup>). For the third, k = 2, and fourth dimensions, k =3, the PEs will be sin(0/10000<sup>2/4</sup>) and cos(0/10000<sup>2/4</sup>), respectively. \n",
