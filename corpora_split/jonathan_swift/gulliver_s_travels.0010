several ways, every feature of his visage, and stared, as at an object
he had never seen before; then approaching nearer, lifted up his
fore-paw, whether out of curiosity or mischief I could not tell; but I
drew my hanger, and gave him a good blow with the flat side of it, for
I durst not strike with the edge, fearing the inhabitants might be
provoked against me, if they should come to know that I had killed or
maimed any of their cattle. When the beast felt the smart, he drew
back, and roared so loud, that a herd of at least forty came flocking
about me from the next field, howling and making odious faces; but I
ran to the body of a tree, and leaning my back against it, kept them
off by waving my hanger. Several of this cursed brood, getting hold of
the branches behind, leaped up into the tree, whence they began to
discharge their excrements on my head; however, I escaped pretty well
by sticking close to the stem of the tree, but was almost stifled with
the filth, which fell about me on every side.

In the midst of this distress, I observed them all to run away on a
sudden as fast as they could; at which I ventured to leave the tree and
pursue the road, wondering what it was that could put them into this
fright. But looking on my left hand, I saw a horse walking softly in
the field; which my persecutors having sooner discovered, was the cause
of their flight. The horse started a little, when he came near me, but
soon recovering himself, looked full in my face with manifest tokens of
wonder; he viewed my hands and feet, walking round me several times. I
would have pursued my journey, but he placed himself directly in the
way, yet looking with a very mild aspect, never offering the least
violence. We stood gazing at each other for some time; at last I took
the boldness to reach my hand towards his neck with a design to stroke
it, using the common style and whistle of jockeys, when they are going
to handle a strange horse. But this animal seemed to receive my
civilities with disdain, shook his head, and bent his brows, softly
raising up his right fore-foot to remove my hand. Then he neighed three
or four times, but in so different a cadence, that I almost began to
think he was speaking to himself, in some language of his own.

While he and I were thus employed, another horse came up; who applying
himself to the first in a very formal manner, they gently struck each
other’s right hoof before, neighing several times by turns, and varying
the sound, which seemed to be almost articulate. They went some paces
off, as if it were to confer together, walking side by side, backward
and forward, like persons deliberating upon some affair of weight, but
often turning their eyes towards me, as it were to watch that I might
not escape. I was amazed to see such actions and behaviour in brute
beasts; and concluded with myself, that if the inhabitants of this
country were endued with a proportionable degree of reason, they must
needs be the wisest people upon earth. This thought gave me so much
comfort, that I resolved to go forward, until I could discover some
house or village, or meet with any of the natives, leaving the two
horses to discourse together as they pleased. But the first, who was a
dapple gray, observing me to steal off, neighed after me in so
expressive a tone, that I fancied myself to understand what he meant;
whereupon I turned back, and came near to him to expect his farther
commands: but concealing my fear as much as I could, for I began to be
in some pain how this adventure might terminate; and the reader will
easily believe I did not much like my present situation.

The two horses came up close to me, looking with great earnestness upon
my face and hands. The gray steed rubbed my hat all round with his
right fore-hoof, and discomposed it so much that I was forced to adjust
it better by taking it off and settling it again; whereat, both he and
his companion (who was a brown bay) appeared to be much surprised: the
latter felt the lappet of my coat, and finding it to hang loose about
me, they both looked with new signs of wonder. He stroked my right
hand, seeming to admire the softness and colour; but he squeezed it so
hard between his hoof and his pastern, that I was forced to roar; after
which they both touched me with all possible tenderness. They were
under great perplexity about my shoes and stockings, which they felt
very often, neighing to each other, and using various gestures, not
unlike those of a philosopher, when he would attempt to solve some new
and difficult phenomenon.

Upon the whole, the behaviour of these animals was so orderly and
rational, so acute and judicious, that I at last concluded they must
needs be magicians, who had thus metamorphosed themselves upon some
design, and seeing a stranger in the way, resolved to divert themselves
with him; or, perhaps, were really amazed at the sight of a man so very
different in habit, feature, and complexion, from those who might
probably live in so remote a climate. Upon the strength of this
reasoning, I ventured to address them in the following manner:
“Gentlemen, if you be conjurers, as I have good cause to believe, you
can understand my language; therefore I make bold to let your worships
know that I am a poor distressed Englishman, driven by his misfortunes
upon your coast; and I entreat one of you to let me ride upon his back,
as if he were a real horse, to some house or village where I can be
relieved. In return of which favour, I will make you a present of this
knife and bracelet,” taking them out of my pocket. The two creatures
stood silent while I spoke, seeming to listen with great attention, and
when I had ended, they neighed frequently towards each other, as if
they were engaged in serious conversation. I plainly observed that
their language expressed the passions very well, and the words might,
with little pains, be resolved into an alphabet more easily than the
Chinese.

I could frequently distinguish the word _Yahoo_, which was repeated by
each of them several times: and although it was impossible for me to
conjecture what it meant, yet while the two horses were busy in
conversation, I endeavoured to practise this word upon my tongue; and
as soon as they were silent, I boldly pronounced _Yahoo_ in a loud
voice, imitating at the same time, as near as I could, the neighing of
a horse; at which they were both visibly surprised; and the gray
repeated the same word twice, as if he meant to teach me the right
accent; wherein I spoke after him as well as I could, and found myself
perceivably to improve every time, though very far from any degree of
perfection. Then the bay tried me with a second word, much harder to be
pronounced; but reducing it to the English orthography, may be spelt
thus, _Houyhnhnm_. I did not succeed in this so well as in the former;
but after two or three farther trials, I had better fortune; and they
both appeared amazed at my capacity.

After some further discourse, which I then conjectured might relate to
me, the two friends took their leaves, with the same compliment of
striking each other’s hoof; and the gray made me signs that I should
walk before him; wherein I thought it prudent to comply, till I could
find a better director. When I offered to slacken my pace, he would cry
_hhuun hhuun_: I guessed his meaning, and gave him to understand, as
well as I could, “that I was weary, and not able to walk faster;” upon
which he would stand a while to let me rest.


CHAPTER II.

The author conducted by a Houyhnhnm to his house. The house described.
The author’s reception. The food of the Houyhnhnms. The author in
distress for want of meat, is at last relieved. His manner of feeding
in this country.


Having travelled about three miles, we came to a long kind of building,
made of timber stuck in the ground, and wattled across; the roof was
low and covered with straw. I now began to be a little comforted; and
took out some toys, which travellers usually carry for presents to the
savage Indians of America, and other parts, in hopes the people of the
house would be thereby encouraged to receive me kindly. The horse made
me a sign to go in first; it was a large room with a smooth clay floor,
and a rack and manger, extending the whole length on one side. There
were three nags and two mares, not eating, but some of them sitting
down upon their hams, which I very much wondered at; but wondered more
to see the rest employed in domestic business; these seemed but
ordinary cattle. However, this confirmed my first opinion, that a
people who could so far civilize brute animals, must needs excel in
wisdom all the nations of the world. The gray came in just after, and
thereby prevented any ill treatment which the others might have given
me. He neighed to them several times in a style of authority, and
received answers.

Beyond this room there were three others, reaching the length of the
house, to which you passed through three doors, opposite to each other,
in the manner of a vista. We went through the second room towards the
third. Here the gray walked in first, beckoning me to attend: I waited
in the second room, and got ready my presents for the master and
mistress of the house; they were two knives, three bracelets of false
pearls, a small looking-glass, and a bead necklace. The horse neighed
three or four times, and I waited to hear some answers in a human
voice, but I heard no other returns than in the same dialect, only one
or two a little shriller than his. I began to think that this house
must belong to some person of great note among them, because there
appeared so much ceremony before I could gain admittance. But, that a
man of quality should be served all by horses, was beyond my
comprehension. I feared my brain was disturbed by my sufferings and
misfortunes. I roused myself, and looked about me in the room where I
was left alone: this was furnished like the first, only after a more
elegant manner. I rubbed my eyes often, but the same objects still
occurred. I pinched my arms and sides to awake myself, hoping I might
be in a dream. I then absolutely concluded, that all these appearances
could be nothing else but necromancy and magic. But I had no time to
pursue these reflections; for the gray horse came to the door, and made
me a sign to follow him into the third room where I saw a very comely
mare, together with a colt and foal, sitting on their haunches upon
mats of straw, not unartfully made, and perfectly neat and clean.

The mare soon after my entrance rose from her mat, and coming up close,
after having nicely observed my hands and face, gave me a most
contemptuous look; and turning to the horse, I heard the word _Yahoo_
often repeated betwixt them; the meaning of which word I could not then
comprehend, although it was the first I had learned to pronounce. But I
was soon better informed, to my everlasting mortification; for the
horse, beckoning to me with his head, and repeating the _hhuun_,
_hhuun_, as he did upon the road, which I understood was to attend him,
led me out into a kind of court, where was another building, at some
distance from the house. Here we entered, and I saw three of those
detestable creatures, which I first met after my landing, feeding upon
roots, and the flesh of some animals, which I afterwards found to be
that of asses and dogs, and now and then a cow, dead by accident or
disease. They were all tied by the neck with strong withes, fastened to
a beam; they held their food between the claws of their forefeet, and
tore it with their teeth.

The master horse ordered a sorrel nag, one of his servants, to untie
the largest of these animals, and take him into the yard. The beast and
I were brought close together, and by our countenances diligently
compared both by master and servant, who thereupon repeated several
times the word _Yahoo_. My horror and astonishment are not to be
described, when I observed in this abominable animal, a perfect human
figure: the face of it indeed was flat and broad, the nose depressed,
the lips large, and the mouth wide; but these differences are common to
all savage nations, where the lineaments of the countenance are
distorted, by the natives suffering their infants to lie grovelling on
the earth, or by carrying them on their backs, nuzzling with their face
against the mothers’ shoulders. The forefeet of the _Yahoo_ differed
from my hands in nothing else but the length of the nails, the
coarseness and brownness of the palms, and the hairiness on the backs.
There was the same resemblance between our feet, with the same
differences; which I knew very well, though the horses did not, because
of my shoes and stockings; the same in every part of our bodies except
as to hairiness and colour, which I have already described.

The great difficulty that seemed to stick with the two horses, was to
see the rest of my body so very different from that of a _Yahoo_, for
which I was obliged to my clothes, whereof they had no conception. The
sorrel nag offered me a root, which he held (after their manner, as we
shall describe in its proper place) between his hoof and pastern; I
took it in my hand, and, having smelt it, returned it to him again as
civilly as I could. He brought out of the _Yahoos_’ kennel a piece of
ass’s flesh; but it smelt so offensively that I turned from it with
loathing: he then threw it to the _Yahoo_, by whom it was greedily
devoured. He afterwards showed me a wisp of hay, and a fetlock full of
oats; but I shook my head, to signify that neither of these were food
for me. And indeed I now apprehended that I must absolutely starve, if
I did not get to some of my own species; for as to those filthy
_Yahoos_, although there were few greater lovers of mankind at that
time than myself, yet I confess I never saw any sensitive being so
detestable on all accounts; and the more I came near them the more
hateful they grew, while I stayed in that country. This the master
horse observed by my behaviour, and therefore sent the _Yahoo_ back to
his kennel. He then put his fore-hoof to his mouth, at which I was much
surprised, although he did it with ease, and with a motion that
appeared perfectly natural, and made other signs, to know what I would
eat; but I could not return him such an answer as he was able to
apprehend; and if he had understood me, I did not see how it was
possible to contrive any way for finding myself nourishment. While we
were thus engaged, I observed a cow passing by, whereupon I pointed to
her, and expressed a desire to go and milk her. This had its effect;
for he led me back into the house, and ordered a mare-servant to open a
room, where a good store of milk lay in earthen and wooden vessels,
after a very orderly and cleanly manner. She gave me a large bowlful,
of which I drank very heartily, and found myself well refreshed.

About noon, I saw coming towards the house a kind of vehicle drawn like
a sledge by four _Yahoos_. There was in it an old steed, who seemed to
be of quality; he alighted with his hind-feet forward, having by
accident got a hurt in his left fore-foot. He came to dine with our
horse, who received him with great civility. They dined in the best
room, and had oats boiled in milk for the second course, which the old
horse ate warm, but the rest cold. Their mangers were placed circular
in the middle of the room, and divided into several partitions, round
which they sat on their haunches, upon bosses of straw. In the middle
was a large rack, with angles answering to every partition of the
manger; so that each horse and mare ate their own hay, and their own
mash of oats and milk, with much decency and regularity. The behaviour
of the young colt and foal appeared very modest, and that of the master
and mistress extremely cheerful and complaisant to their guest. The
gray ordered me to stand by him; and much discourse passed between him
and his friend concerning me, as I found by the stranger’s often
looking on me, and the frequent repetition of the word _Yahoo_.

I happened to wear my gloves, which the master gray observing, seemed
perplexed, discovering signs of wonder what I had done to my forefeet.
He put his hoof three or four times to them, as if he would signify,
that I should reduce them to their former shape, which I presently did,
pulling off both my gloves, and putting them into my pocket. This
occasioned farther talk; and I saw the company was pleased with my
behaviour, whereof I soon found the good effects. I was ordered to
speak the few words I understood; and while they were at dinner, the
master taught me the names for oats, milk, fire, water, and some
others, which I could readily pronounce after him, having from my youth
a great facility in learning languages.

When dinner was done, the master horse took me aside, and by signs and
words made me understand the concern he was in that I had nothing to
eat. Oats in their tongue are called _hlunnh_. This word I pronounced
two or three times; for although I had refused them at first, yet, upon
second thoughts, I considered that I could contrive to make of them a
kind of bread, which might be sufficient, with milk, to keep me alive,
till I could make my escape to some other country, and to creatures of
my own species. The horse immediately ordered a white mare servant of
his family to bring me a good quantity of oats in a sort of wooden
tray. These I heated before the fire, as well as I could, and rubbed
them till the husks came off, which I made a shift to winnow from the
grain. I ground and beat them between two stones; then took water, and
made them into a paste or cake, which I toasted at the fire and eat
warm with milk. It was at first a very insipid diet, though common
enough in many parts of Europe, but grew tolerable by time; and having
been often reduced to hard fare in my life, this was not the first
experiment I had made how easily nature is satisfied. And I cannot but
observe, that I never had one hour’s sickness while I stayed in this
island. It is true, I sometimes made a shift to catch a rabbit, or
bird, by springs made of _Yahoo’s_ hairs; and I often gathered
wholesome herbs, which I boiled, and ate as salads with my bread; and
now and then, for a rarity, I made a little butter, and drank the whey.
I was at first at a great loss for salt, but custom soon reconciled me
to the want of it; and I am confident that the frequent use of salt
among us is an effect of luxury, and was first introduced only as a
provocative to drink, except where it is necessary for preserving flesh
in long voyages, or in places remote from great markets; for we observe
no animal to be fond of it but man, and as to myself, when I left this
country, it was a great while before I could endure the taste of it in
anything that I ate.

This is enough to say upon the subject of my diet, wherewith other
travellers fill their books, as if the readers were personally
concerned whether we fare well or ill. However, it was necessary to
mention this matter, lest the world should think it impossible that I
could find sustenance for three years in such a country, and among such
inhabitants.

When it grew towards evening, the master horse ordered a place for me
to lodge in; it was but six yards from the house and separated from the
stable of the _Yahoos_. Here I got some straw, and covering myself with
my own clothes, slept very sound. But I was in a short time better
accommodated, as the reader shall know hereafter, when I come to treat
more particularly about my way of living.


CHAPTER III.

The author studies to learn the language. The Houyhnhnm, his master,
assists in teaching him. The language described. Several Houyhnhnms of
quality come out of curiosity to see the author. He gives his master a
short account of his voyage.


My principal endeavour was to learn the language, which my master (for
so I shall henceforth call him), and his children, and every servant of
his house, were desirous to teach me; for they looked upon it as a
prodigy, that a brute animal should discover such marks of a rational
creature. I pointed to every thing, and inquired the name of it, which
I wrote down in my journal-book when I was alone, and corrected my bad
accent by desiring those of the family to pronounce it often. In this
employment, a sorrel nag, one of the under-servants, was very ready to
assist me.

In speaking, they pronounced through the nose and throat, and their
language approaches nearest to the High-Dutch, or German, of any I know
in Europe; but is much more graceful and significant. The emperor
Charles V. made almost the same observation, when he said “that if he
were to speak to his horse, it should be in High-Dutch.”

The curiosity and impatience of my master were so great, that he spent
many hours of his leisure to instruct me. He was convinced (as he
afterwards told me) that I must be a _Yahoo_; but my teachableness,
civility, and cleanliness, astonished him; which were qualities
altogether opposite to those animals. He was most perplexed about my
clothes, reasoning sometimes with himself, whether they were a part of
my body: for I never pulled them off till the family were asleep, and
got them on before they waked in the morning. My master was eager to
learn “whence I came; how I acquired those appearances of reason, which
I discovered in all my actions; and to know my story from my own mouth,
which he hoped he should soon do by the great proficiency I made in
learning and pronouncing their words and sentences.” To help my memory,
I formed all I learned into the English alphabet, and writ the words
down, with the translations. This last, after some time, I ventured to
do in my master’s presence. It cost me much trouble to explain to him
what I was doing; for the inhabitants have not the least idea of books
or literature.

In about ten weeks time, I was able to understand most of his
questions; and in three months, could give him some tolerable answers.
He was extremely curious to know “from what part of the country I came,
and how I was taught to imitate a rational creature; because the
_Yahoos_ (whom he saw I exactly resembled in my head, hands, and face,
that were only visible), with some appearance of cunning, and the
strongest disposition to mischief, were observed to be the most
unteachable of all brutes.” I answered, “that I came over the sea, from
a far place, with many others of my own kind, in a great hollow vessel
made of the bodies of trees: that my companions forced me to land on
this coast, and then left me to shift for myself.” It was with some
difficulty, and by the help of many signs, that I brought him to
understand me. He replied, “that I must needs be mistaken, or that I
said the thing which was not;” for they have no word in their language
to express lying or falsehood. “He knew it was impossible that there
could be a country beyond the sea, or that a parcel of brutes could
move a wooden vessel whither they pleased upon water. He was sure no
_Houyhnhnm_ alive could make such a vessel, nor would trust _Yahoos_ to
manage it.”

The word _Houyhnhnm_, in their tongue, signifies a _horse_, and, in its
etymology, the _perfection of nature_. I told my master, “that I was at
a loss for expression, but would improve as fast as I could; and hoped,
in a short time, I should be able to tell him wonders.” He was pleased
to direct his own mare, his colt, and foal, and the servants of the
family, to take all opportunities of instructing me; and every day, for
two or three hours, he was at the same pains himself. Several horses
and mares of quality in the neighbourhood came often to our house, upon
the report spread of “a wonderful _Yahoo_, that could speak like a
_Houyhnhnm_, and seemed, in his words and actions, to discover some
glimmerings of reason.” These delighted to converse with me: they put
many questions, and received such answers as I was able to return. By
all these advantages I made so great a progress, that, in five months
from my arrival I understood whatever was spoken, and could express
myself tolerably well.

The _Houyhnhnms_, who came to visit my master out of a design of seeing
and talking with me, could hardly believe me to be a right _Yahoo_,
because my body had a different covering from others of my kind. They
were astonished to observe me without the usual hair or skin, except on
my head, face, and hands; but I discovered that secret to my master
upon an accident which happened about a fortnight before.

I have already told the reader, that every night, when the family were
gone to bed, it was my custom to strip, and cover myself with my
clothes. It happened, one morning early, that my master sent for me by
the sorrel nag, who was his valet. When he came I was fast asleep, my
clothes fallen off on one side, and my shirt above my waist. I awaked
at the noise he made, and observed him to deliver his message in some
disorder; after which he went to my master, and in a great fright gave
him a very confused account of what he had seen. This I presently
discovered, for, going as soon as I was dressed to pay my attendance
upon his honour, he asked me “the meaning of what his servant had
reported, that I was not the same thing when I slept, as I appeared to
be at other times; that his valet assured him, some part of me was
white, some yellow, at least not so white, and some brown.”

I had hitherto concealed the secret of my dress, in order to
distinguish myself, as much as possible, from that cursed race of
_Yahoos_; but now I found it in vain to do so any longer. Besides, I
considered that my clothes and shoes would soon wear out, which already
were in a declining condition, and must be supplied by some contrivance
from the hides of _Yahoos_, or other brutes; whereby the whole secret
would be known. I therefore told my master, “that in the country whence
I came, those of my kind always covered their bodies with the hairs of
certain animals prepared by art, as well for decency as to avoid the
inclemencies of air, both hot and cold; of which, as to my own person,
I would give him immediate conviction, if he pleased to command me:
only desiring his excuse, if I did not expose those parts that nature
taught us to conceal.” He said, “my discourse was all very strange, but
especially the last part; for he could not understand, why nature
should teach us to conceal what nature had given; that neither himself
nor family were ashamed of any parts of their bodies; but, however, I
might do as I pleased.” Whereupon I first unbuttoned my coat, and
pulled it off. I did the same with my waistcoat. I drew off my shoes,
stockings, and breeches. I let my shirt down to my waist, and drew up
the bottom; fastening it like a girdle about my middle, to hide my
nakedness.

My master observed the whole performance with great signs of curiosity
and admiration. He took up all my clothes in his pastern, one piece
after another, and examined them diligently; he then stroked my body
very gently, and looked round me several times; after which, he said,
it was plain I must be a perfect _Yahoo_; but that I differed very much
from the rest of my species in the softness, whiteness, and smoothness
of my skin; my want of hair in several parts of my body; the shape and
shortness of my claws behind and before; and my affectation of walking
continually on my two hinder feet. He desired to see no more; and gave
me leave to put on my clothes again, for I was shuddering with cold.

I expressed my uneasiness at his giving me so often the appellation of
_Yahoo_, an odious animal, for which I had so utter a hatred and
contempt: I begged he would forbear applying that word to me, and make
the same order in his family and among his friends whom he suffered to
see me. I requested likewise, “that the secret of my having a false
covering to my body, might be known to none but himself, at least as
long as my present clothing should last; for as to what the sorrel nag,
his valet, had observed, his honour might command him to conceal it.”

All this my master very graciously consented to; and thus the secret
was kept till my clothes began to wear out, which I was forced to
supply by several contrivances that shall hereafter be mentioned. In
the meantime, he desired “I would go on with my utmost diligence to
learn their language, because he was more astonished at my capacity for
speech and reason, than at the figure of my body, whether it were
covered or not;” adding, “that he waited with some impatience to hear
the wonders which I promised to tell him.”

From thenceforward he doubled the pains he had been at to instruct me:
he brought me into all company, and made them treat me with civility;
“because,” as he told them, privately, “this would put me into good
humour, and make me more diverting.”

Every day, when I waited on him, beside the trouble he was at in
teaching, he would ask me several questions concerning myself, which I
answered as well as I could, and by these means he had already received
some general ideas, though very imperfect. It would be tedious to
relate the several steps by which I advanced to a more regular
conversation; but the first account I gave of myself in any order and
length was to this purpose:

“That I came from a very far country, as I already had attempted to
tell him, with about fifty more of my own species; that we travelled
upon the seas in a great hollow vessel made of wood, and larger than
his honour’s house. I described the ship to him in the best terms I
could, and explained, by the help of my handkerchief displayed, how it
was driven forward by the wind. That upon a quarrel among us, I was set
on shore on this coast, where I walked forward, without knowing
whither, till he delivered me from the persecution of those execrable
_Yahoos_.” He asked me, “who made the ship, and how it was possible
that the _Houyhnhnms_ of my country would leave it to the management of
brutes?” My answer was, “that I durst proceed no further in my
relation, unless he would give me his word and honour that he would not
be offended, and then I would tell him the wonders I had so often
promised.” He agreed; and I went on by assuring him, that the ship was
made by creatures like myself; who, in all the countries I had
travelled, as well as in my own, were the only governing rational
animals; and that upon my arrival hither, I was as much astonished to
see the _Houyhnhnms_ act like rational beings, as he, or his friends,
could be, in finding some marks of reason in a creature he was pleased
to call a _Yahoo_; to which I owned my resemblance in every part, but
could not account for their degenerate and brutal nature. I said
farther, “that if good fortune ever restored me to my native country,
to relate my travels hither, as I resolved to do, everybody would
believe, that I said the thing that was not, that I invented the story
out of my own head; and (with all possible respect to himself, his
family, and friends, and under his promise of not being offended) our
countrymen would hardly think it probable that a _Houyhnhnm_ should be
the presiding creature of a nation, and a _Yahoo_ the brute.”


CHAPTER IV.

The Houyhnhnms’ notion of truth and falsehood. The author’s discourse
disapproved by his master. The author gives a more particular account
of himself, and the accidents of his voyage.


My master heard me with great appearances of uneasiness in his
countenance; because _doubting_, or not believing, are so little known
in this country, that the inhabitants cannot tell how to behave
themselves under such circumstances. And I remember, in frequent
discourses with my master concerning the nature of manhood in other
parts of the world, having occasion to talk of _lying_ and _false
representation_, it was with much difficulty that he comprehended what
I meant, although he had otherwise a most acute judgment. For he argued
thus: “that the use of speech was to make us understand one another,
and to receive information of facts; now, if any one _said the thing
which was not_, these ends were defeated, because I cannot properly be
said to understand him; and I am so far from receiving information,
that he leaves me worse than in ignorance; for I am led to believe a
thing black, when it is white, and short, when it is long.” And these
were all the notions he had concerning that faculty of _lying_, so
perfectly well understood, and so universally practised, among human
creatures.

To return from this digression. When I asserted that the _Yahoos_ were
the only governing animals in my country, which my master said was
altogether past his conception, he desired to know, “whether we had
_Houyhnhnms_ among us, and what was their employment?” I told him, “we
had great numbers; that in summer they grazed in the fields, and in
winter were kept in houses with hay and oats, where _Yahoo_ servants
were employed to rub their skins smooth, comb their manes, pick their
feet, serve them with food, and make their beds.” “I understand you
well,” said my master: “it is now very plain, from all you have spoken,
that whatever share of reason the _Yahoos_ pretend to, the _Houyhnhnms_
are your masters; I heartily wish our _Yahoos_ would be so tractable.”
I begged “his honour would please to excuse me from proceeding any
further, because I was very certain that the account he expected from
me would be highly displeasing.” But he insisted in commanding me to
let him know the best and the worst. I told him “he should be obeyed.”
I owned “that the _Houyhnhnms_ among us, whom we called horses, were
the most generous and comely animals we had; that they excelled in
strength and swiftness; and when they belonged to persons of quality,
were employed in travelling, racing, or drawing chariots; they were
treated with much kindness and care, till they fell into diseases, or
became foundered in the feet; but then they were sold, and used to all
kind of drudgery till they died; after which their skins were stripped,
and sold for what they were worth, and their bodies left to be devoured
by dogs and birds of prey. But the common race of horses had not so
good fortune, being kept by farmers and carriers, and other mean
people, who put them to greater labour, and fed them worse.” I
described, as well as I could, our way of riding; the shape and use of
a bridle, a saddle, a spur, and a whip; of harness and wheels. I added,
“that we fastened plates of a certain hard substance, called iron, at
the bottom of their feet, to preserve their hoofs from being broken by
the stony ways, on which we often travelled.”

My master, after some expressions of great indignation, wondered “how
we dared to venture upon a _Houyhnhnm’s_ back; for he was sure, that
the weakest servant in his house would be able to shake off the
strongest _Yahoo_; or by lying down and rolling on his back, squeeze
the brute to death.” I answered “that our horses were trained up, from
three or four years old, to the several uses we intended them for; that
if any of them proved intolerably vicious, they were employed for
carriages; that they were severely beaten, while they were young, for
any mischievous tricks; that the males, designed for the common use of
riding or draught, were generally castrated about two years after their
birth, to take down their spirits, and make them more tame and gentle;
that they were indeed sensible of rewards and punishments; but his
honour would please to consider, that they had not the least tincture
of reason, any more than the _Yahoos_ in this country.”

It put me to the pains of many circumlocutions, to give my master a
right idea of what I spoke; for their language does not abound in
variety of words, because their wants and passions are fewer than among
us. But it is impossible to express his noble resentment at our savage
treatment of the _Houyhnhnm_ race; particularly after I had explained
the manner and use of castrating horses among us, to hinder them from
propagating their kind, and to render them more servile. He said, “if
it were possible there could be any country where _Yahoos_ alone were
endued with reason, they certainly must be the governing animal;
because reason in time will always prevail against brutal strength.
But, considering the frame of our bodies, and especially of mine, he
thought no creature of equal bulk was so ill-contrived for employing
that reason in the common offices of life;” whereupon he desired to
know “whether those among whom I lived resembled me, or the _Yahoos_ of
his country?” I assured him, “that I was as well shaped as most of my
age; but the younger, and the females, were much more soft and tender,
and the skins of the latter generally as white as milk.” He said, “I
differed indeed from other _Yahoos_, being much more cleanly, and not
altogether so deformed; but, in point of real advantage, he thought I
differed for the worse: that my nails were of no use either to my fore
or hinder feet; as to my forefeet, he could not properly call them by
that name, for he never observed me to walk upon them; that they were
too soft to bear the ground; that I generally went with them uncovered;
neither was the covering I sometimes wore on them of the same shape, or
so strong as that on my feet behind: that I could not walk with any
security, for if either of my hinder feet slipped, I must inevitably
fall.” He then began to find fault with other parts of my body: “the
flatness of my face, the prominence of my nose, my eyes placed directly
in front, so that I could not look on either side without turning my
head: that I was not able to feed myself, without lifting one of my
forefeet to my mouth: and therefore nature had placed those joints to
answer that necessity. He knew not what could be the use of those
several clefts and divisions in my feet behind; that these were too
soft to bear the hardness and sharpness of stones, without a covering
made from the skin of some other brute; that my whole body wanted a
fence against heat and cold, which I was forced to put on and off every
day, with tediousness and trouble: and lastly, that he observed every
animal in this country naturally to abhor the _Yahoos_, whom the weaker
avoided, and the stronger drove from them. So that, supposing us to
have the gift of reason, he could not see how it were possible to cure
that natural antipathy, which every creature discovered against us; nor
consequently how we could tame and render them serviceable. However, he
would,” as he said, “debate the matter no farther, because he was more
desirous to know my own story, the country where I was born, and the
several actions and events of my life, before I came hither.”

I assured him, “how extremely desirous I was that he should be
satisfied on every point; but I doubted much, whether it would be
possible for me to explain myself on several subjects, whereof his
honour could have no conception; because I saw nothing in his country
to which I could resemble them; that, however, I would do my best, and
strive to express myself by similitudes, humbly desiring his assistance
when I wanted proper words;” which he was pleased to promise me.

I said, “my birth was of honest parents, in an island called England;
which was remote from his country, as many days’ journey as the
strongest of his honour’s servants could travel in the annual course of
the sun; that I was bred a surgeon, whose trade it is to cure wounds
and hurts in the body, gotten by accident or violence; that my country
was governed by a female man, whom we called queen; that I left it to
get riches, whereby I might maintain myself and family, when I should
return; that, in my last voyage, I was commander of the ship, and had
about fifty _Yahoos_ under me, many of which died at sea, and I was
forced to supply them by others picked out from several nations; that
our ship was twice in danger of being sunk, the first time by a great
storm, and the second by striking against a rock.” Here my master
interposed, by asking me, “how I could persuade strangers, out of
different countries, to venture with me, after the losses I had
sustained, and the hazards I had run?” I said, “they were fellows of
desperate fortunes, forced to fly from the places of their birth on
account of their poverty or their crimes. Some were undone by lawsuits;
others spent all they had in drinking, whoring, and gaming; others fled
for treason; many for murder, theft, poisoning, robbery, perjury,
forgery, coining false money, for committing rapes, or sodomy; for
flying from their colours, or deserting to the enemy; and most of them
had broken prison; none of these durst return to their native
countries, for fear of being hanged, or of starving in a jail; and
therefore they were under the necessity of seeking a livelihood in
other places.”

During this discourse, my master was pleased to interrupt me several
times. I had made use of many circumlocutions in describing to him the
nature of the several crimes for which most of our crew had been forced
to fly their country. This labour took up several days’ conversation,
before he was able to comprehend me. He was wholly at a loss to know
what could be the use or necessity of practising those vices. To clear
up which, I endeavoured to give some ideas of the desire of power and
riches; of the terrible effects of lust, intemperance, malice, and
envy. All this I was forced to define and describe by putting cases and
making suppositions. After which, like one whose imagination was struck
with something never seen or heard of before, he would lift up his eyes
with amazement and indignation. Power, government, war, law,
punishment, and a thousand other things, had no terms wherein that
language could express them, which made the difficulty almost
insuperable, to give my master any conception of what I meant. But
being of an excellent understanding, much improved by contemplation and
converse, he at last arrived at a competent knowledge of what human
nature, in our parts of the world, is capable to perform, and desired I
would give him some particular account of that land which we call
Europe, but especially of my own country.

The author at his master’s command, informs him of the state of
England. The causes of war among the princes of Europe. The author
begins to explain the English constitution.


The reader may please to observe, that the following extract of many
conversations I had with my master, contains a summary of the most
material points which were discoursed at several times for above two
years; his honour often desiring fuller satisfaction, as I farther
improved in the _Houyhnhnm_ tongue. I laid before him, as well as I
could, the whole state of Europe; I discoursed of trade and
manufactures, of arts and sciences; and the answers I gave to all the
questions he made, as they arose upon several subjects, were a fund of
conversation not to be exhausted. But I shall here only set down the
substance of what passed between us concerning my own country, reducing
it in order as well as I can, without any regard to time or other
circumstances, while I strictly adhere to truth. My only concern is,
that I shall hardly be able to do justice to my master’s arguments and
