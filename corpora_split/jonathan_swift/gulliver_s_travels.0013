be poisoned, and paddling out of the reach of their darts (being a calm
day), I made a shift to suck the wound, and dress it as well as I
could.

I was at a loss what to do, for I durst not return to the same
landing-place, but stood to the north, and was forced to paddle, for
the wind, though very gentle, was against me, blowing north-west. As I
was looking about for a secure landing-place, I saw a sail to the
north-north-east, which appearing every minute more visible, I was in
some doubt whether I should wait for them or not; but at last my
detestation of the _Yahoo_ race prevailed: and turning my canoe, I
sailed and paddled together to the south, and got into the same creek
whence I set out in the morning, choosing rather to trust myself among
these barbarians, than live with European _Yahoos_. I drew up my canoe
as close as I could to the shore, and hid myself behind a stone by the
little brook, which, as I have already said, was excellent water.

The ship came within half a league of this creek, and sent her
long-boat with vessels to take in fresh water (for the place, it seems,
was very well known); but I did not observe it, till the boat was
almost on shore; and it was too late to seek another hiding-place. The
seamen at their landing observed my canoe, and rummaging it all over,
easily conjectured that the owner could not be far off. Four of them,
well armed, searched every cranny and lurking-hole, till at last they
found me flat on my face behind the stone. They gazed awhile in
admiration at my strange uncouth dress; my coat made of skins, my
wooden-soled shoes, and my furred stockings; whence, however, they
concluded, I was not a native of the place, who all go naked. One of
the seamen, in Portuguese, bid me rise, and asked who I was. I
understood that language very well, and getting upon my feet, said, “I
was a poor _Yahoo_ banished from the _Houyhnhnms_, and desired they
would please to let me depart.” They admired to hear me answer them in
their own tongue, and saw by my complexion I must be a European; but
were at a loss to know what I meant by _Yahoos_ and _Houyhnhnms_; and
at the same time fell a-laughing at my strange tone in speaking, which
resembled the neighing of a horse. I trembled all the while betwixt
fear and hatred. I again desired leave to depart, and was gently moving
to my canoe; but they laid hold of me, desiring to know, “what country
I was of? whence I came?” with many other questions. I told them “I was
born in England, whence I came about five years ago, and then their
country and ours were at peace. I therefore hoped they would not treat
me as an enemy, since I meant them no harm, but was a poor _Yahoo_
seeking some desolate place where to pass the remainder of his
unfortunate life.”

When they began to talk, I thought I never heard or saw any thing more
unnatural; for it appeared to me as monstrous as if a dog or a cow
should speak in England, or a _Yahoo_ in _Houyhnhnmland_. The honest
Portuguese were equally amazed at my strange dress, and the odd manner
of delivering my words, which, however, they understood very well. They
spoke to me with great humanity, and said, “they were sure the captain
would carry me _gratis_ to Lisbon, whence I might return to my own
country; that two of the seamen would go back to the ship, inform the
captain of what they had seen, and receive his orders; in the mean
time, unless I would give my solemn oath not to fly, they would secure
me by force. I thought it best to comply with their proposal. They were
very curious to know my story, but I gave them very little
satisfaction, and they all conjectured that my misfortunes had impaired
my reason. In two hours the boat, which went laden with vessels of
water, returned, with the captain’s command to fetch me on board. I
fell on my knees to preserve my liberty; but all was in vain; and the
men, having tied me with cords, heaved me into the boat, whence I was
taken into the ship, and thence into the captain’s cabin.

His name was Pedro de Mendez; he was a very courteous and generous
person. He entreated me to give some account of myself, and desired to
know what I would eat or drink; said, “I should be used as well as
himself;” and spoke so many obliging things, that I wondered to find
such civilities from a _Yahoo_. However, I remained silent and sullen;
I was ready to faint at the very smell of him and his men. At last I
desired something to eat out of my own canoe; but he ordered me a
chicken, and some excellent wine, and then directed that I should be
put to bed in a very clean cabin. I would not undress myself, but lay
on the bed-clothes, and in half an hour stole out, when I thought the
crew was at dinner, and getting to the side of the ship, was going to
leap into the sea, and swim for my life, rather than continue among
_Yahoos_. But one of the seamen prevented me, and having informed the
captain, I was chained to my cabin.

After dinner, Don Pedro came to me, and desired to know my reason for
so desperate an attempt; assured me, “he only meant to do me all the
service he was able;” and spoke so very movingly, that at last I
descended to treat him like an animal which had some little portion of
reason. I gave him a very short relation of my voyage; of the
conspiracy against me by my own men; of the country where they set me
on shore, and of my five years residence there. All which he looked
upon as if it were a dream or a vision; whereat I took great offence;
for I had quite forgot the faculty of lying, so peculiar to _Yahoos_,
in all countries where they preside, and, consequently, their
disposition of suspecting truth in others of their own species. I asked
him, “whether it were the custom in his country to say the thing which
was not?” I assured him, “I had almost forgot what he meant by
falsehood, and if I had lived a thousand years in _Houyhnhnmland_, I
should never have heard a lie from the meanest servant; that I was
altogether indifferent whether he believed me or not; but, however, in
return for his favours, I would give so much allowance to the
corruption of his nature, as to answer any objection he would please to
make, and then he might easily discover the truth.”

The captain, a wise man, after many endeavours to catch me tripping in
some part of my story, at last began to have a better opinion of my
veracity. But he added, “that since I professed so inviolable an
attachment to truth, I must give him my word and honour to bear him
company in this voyage, without attempting any thing against my life;
or else he would continue me a prisoner till we arrived at Lisbon.” I
gave him the promise he required; but at the same time protested, “that
I would suffer the greatest hardships, rather than return to live among
_Yahoos_.”

Our voyage passed without any considerable accident. In gratitude to
the captain, I sometimes sat with him, at his earnest request, and
strove to conceal my antipathy against humankind, although it often
broke out; which he suffered to pass without observation. But the
greatest part of the day I confined myself to my cabin, to avoid seeing
any of the crew. The captain had often entreated me to strip myself of
my savage dress, and offered to lend me the best suit of clothes he
had. This I would not be prevailed on to accept, abhorring to cover
myself with any thing that had been on the back of a _Yahoo_. I only
desired he would lend me two clean shirts, which, having been washed
since he wore them, I believed would not so much defile me. These I
changed every second day, and washed them myself.

We arrived at Lisbon, Nov. 5, 1715. At our landing, the captain forced
me to cover myself with his cloak, to prevent the rabble from crowding
about me. I was conveyed to his own house; and at my earnest request he
led me up to the highest room backwards. I conjured him “to conceal
from all persons what I had told him of the _Houyhnhnms_; because the
least hint of such a story would not only draw numbers of people to see
me, but probably put me in danger of being imprisoned, or burnt by the
Inquisition.” The captain persuaded me to accept a suit of clothes
newly made; but I would not suffer the tailor to take my measure;
however, Don Pedro being almost of my size, they fitted me well enough.
He accoutred me with other necessaries, all new, which I aired for
twenty-four hours before I would use them.

The captain had no wife, nor above three servants, none of which were
suffered to attend at meals; and his whole deportment was so obliging,
added to very good human understanding, that I really began to tolerate
his company. He gained so far upon me, that I ventured to look out of
the back window. By degrees I was brought into another room, whence I
peeped into the street, but drew my head back in a fright. In a week’s
time he seduced me down to the door. I found my terror gradually
lessened, but my hatred and contempt seemed to increase. I was at last
bold enough to walk the street in his company, but kept my nose well
stopped with rue, or sometimes with tobacco.

In ten days, Don Pedro, to whom I had given some account of my domestic
affairs, put it upon me, as a matter of honour and conscience, “that I
ought to return to my native country, and live at home with my wife and
children.” He told me, “there was an English ship in the port just
ready to sail, and he would furnish me with all things necessary.” It
would be tedious to repeat his arguments, and my contradictions. He
said, “it was altogether impossible to find such a solitary island as I
desired to live in; but I might command in my own house, and pass my
time in a manner as recluse as I pleased.”

I complied at last, finding I could not do better. I left Lisbon the
24th day of November, in an English merchantman, but who was the master
I never inquired. Don Pedro accompanied me to the ship, and lent me
twenty pounds. He took kind leave of me, and embraced me at parting,
which I bore as well as I could. During this last voyage I had no
commerce with the master or any of his men; but, pretending I was sick,
kept close in my cabin. On the fifth of December, 1715, we cast anchor
in the Downs, about nine in the morning, and at three in the afternoon
I got safe to my house at Rotherhith. [546]

My wife and family received me with great surprise and joy, because
they concluded me certainly dead; but I must freely confess the sight
of them filled me only with hatred, disgust, and contempt; and the
more, by reflecting on the near alliance I had to them. For although,
since my unfortunate exile from the _Houyhnhnm_ country, I had
compelled myself to tolerate the sight of _Yahoos_, and to converse
with Don Pedro de Mendez, yet my memory and imagination were
perpetually filled with the virtues and ideas of those exalted
_Houyhnhnms_. And when I began to consider that, by copulating with one
of the _Yahoo_ species I had become a parent of more, it struck me with
the utmost shame, confusion, and horror.

As soon as I entered the house, my wife took me in her arms, and kissed
me; at which, having not been used to the touch of that odious animal
for so many years, I fell into a swoon for almost an hour. At the time
I am writing, it is five years since my last return to England. During
the first year, I could not endure my wife or children in my presence;
the very smell of them was intolerable; much less could I suffer them
to eat in the same room. To this hour they dare not presume to touch my
bread, or drink out of the same cup, neither was I ever able to let one
of them take me by the hand. The first money I laid out was to buy two
young stone-horses, which I keep in a good stable; and next to them,
the groom is my greatest favourite, for I feel my spirits revived by
the smell he contracts in the stable. My horses understand me tolerably
well; I converse with them at least four hours every day. They are
strangers to bridle or saddle; they live in great amity with me and
friendship to each other.


CHAPTER XII.

The author’s veracity. His design in publishing this work. His censure
of those travellers who swerve from the truth. The author clears
himself from any sinister ends in writing. An objection answered. The
method of planting colonies. His native country commended. The right of
the crown to those countries described by the author is justified. The
difficulty of conquering them. The author takes his last leave of the
reader; proposes his manner of living for the future; gives good
advice, and concludes.


Thus, gentle reader, I have given thee a faithful history of my travels
for sixteen years and above seven months: wherein I have not been so
studious of ornament as of truth. I could, perhaps, like others, have
astonished thee with strange improbable tales; but I rather chose to
relate plain matter of fact, in the simplest manner and style; because
my principal design was to inform, and not to amuse thee.

It is easy for us who travel into remote countries, which are seldom
visited by Englishmen or other Europeans, to form descriptions of
wonderful animals both at sea and land. Whereas a traveller’s chief aim
should be to make men wiser and better, and to improve their minds by
the bad, as well as good, example of what they deliver concerning
foreign places.

I could heartily wish a law was enacted, that every traveller, before
he were permitted to publish his voyages, should be obliged to make
oath before the Lord High Chancellor, that all he intended to print was
absolutely true to the best of his knowledge; for then the world would
no longer be deceived, as it usually is, while some writers, to make
their works pass the better upon the public, impose the grossest
falsities on the unwary reader. I have perused several books of travels
with great delight in my younger days; but having since gone over most
parts of the globe, and been able to contradict many fabulous accounts
from my own observation, it has given me a great disgust against this
part of reading, and some indignation to see the credulity of mankind
so impudently abused. Therefore, since my acquaintance were pleased to
think my poor endeavours might not be unacceptable to my country, I
imposed on myself, as a maxim never to be swerved from, that I would
strictly adhere to truth; neither indeed can I be ever under the least
temptation to vary from it, while I retain in my mind the lectures and
example of my noble master and the other illustrious _Houyhnhnms_ of
whom I had so long the honour to be an humble hearer.


_—Nec si miserum Fortuna Sinonem_

_Finxit_, _vanum etiam_, _mendacemque improba finget_.

I know very well, how little reputation is to be got by writings which
require neither genius nor learning, nor indeed any other talent,
except a good memory, or an exact journal. I know likewise, that
writers of travels, like dictionary-makers, are sunk into oblivion by
the weight and bulk of those who come last, and therefore lie
uppermost. And it is highly probable, that such travellers, who shall
hereafter visit the countries described in this work of mine, may, by
detecting my errors (if there be any), and adding many new discoveries
of their own, justle me out of vogue, and stand in my place, making the
world forget that ever I was an author. This indeed would be too great
a mortification, if I wrote for fame: but as my sole intention was the
public good, I cannot be altogether disappointed. For who can read of
the virtues I have mentioned in the glorious _Houyhnhnms_, without
being ashamed of his own vices, when he considers himself as the
reasoning, governing animal of his country? I shall say nothing of
those remote nations where _Yahoos_ preside; among which the least
corrupted are the _Brobdingnagians_; whose wise maxims in morality and
government it would be our happiness to observe. But I forbear
descanting further, and rather leave the judicious reader to his own
remarks and application.

I am not a little pleased that this work of mine can possibly meet with
no censurers: for what objections can be made against a writer, who
relates only plain facts, that happened in such distant countries,
where we have not the least interest, with respect either to trade or
negotiations? I have carefully avoided every fault with which common
writers of travels are often too justly charged. Besides, I meddle not
the least with any party, but write without passion, prejudice, or
ill-will against any man, or number of men, whatsoever. I write for the
noblest end, to inform and instruct mankind; over whom I may, without
breach of modesty, pretend to some superiority, from the advantages I
received by conversing so long among the most accomplished
_Houyhnhnms_. I write without any view to profit or praise. I never
suffer a word to pass that may look like reflection, or possibly give
the least offence, even to those who are most ready to take it. So that
I hope I may with justice pronounce myself an author perfectly
blameless; against whom the tribes of Answerers, Considerers,
Observers, Reflectors, Detectors, Remarkers, will never be able to find
matter for exercising their talents.

I confess, it was whispered to me, “that I was bound in duty, as a
subject of England, to have given in a memorial to a secretary of state
at my first coming over; because, whatever lands are discovered by a
subject belong to the crown.” But I doubt whether our conquests in the
countries I treat of would be as easy as those of Ferdinando Cortez
over the naked Americans. The _Lilliputians_, I think, are hardly worth
the charge of a fleet and army to reduce them; and I question whether
it might be prudent or safe to attempt the _Brobdingnagians_; or
whether an English army would be much at their ease with the Flying
Island over their heads. The _Houyhnhnms_ indeed appear not to be so
well prepared for war, a science to which they are perfect strangers,
and especially against missive weapons. However, supposing myself to be
a minister of state, I could never give my advice for invading them.
Their prudence, unanimity, unacquaintedness with fear, and their love
of their country, would amply supply all defects in the military art.
Imagine twenty thousand of them breaking into the midst of an European
army, confounding the ranks, overturning the carriages, battering the
warriors’ faces into mummy by terrible yerks from their hinder hoofs.
For they would well deserve the character given to Augustus,
_Recalcitrat undique tutus_. But, instead of proposals for conquering
that magnanimous nation, I rather wish they were in a capacity, or
disposition, to send a sufficient number of their inhabitants for
civilizing Europe, by teaching us the first principles of honour,
justice, truth, temperance, public spirit, fortitude, chastity,
friendship, benevolence, and fidelity. The names of all which virtues
are still retained among us in most languages, and are to be met with
in modern, as well as ancient authors; which I am able to assert from
my own small reading.

But I had another reason, which made me less forward to enlarge his
majesty’s dominions by my discoveries. To say the truth, I had
conceived a few scruples with relation to the distributive justice of
princes upon those occasions. For instance, a crew of pirates are
driven by a storm they know not whither; at length a boy discovers land
from the topmast; they go on shore to rob and plunder, they see a
harmless people, are entertained with kindness; they give the country a
new name; they take formal possession of it for their king; they set up
a rotten plank, or a stone, for a memorial; they murder two or three
dozen of the natives, bring away a couple more, by force, for a sample;
return home, and get their pardon. Here commences a new dominion
acquired with a title by divine right. Ships are sent with the first
opportunity; the natives driven out or destroyed; their princes
tortured to discover their gold; a free license given to all acts of
inhumanity and lust, the earth reeking with the blood of its
inhabitants: and this execrable crew of butchers, employed in so pious
an expedition, is a modern colony, sent to convert and civilize an
idolatrous and barbarous people!

But this description, I confess, does by no means affect the British
nation, who may be an example to the whole world for their wisdom,
care, and justice in planting colonies; their liberal endowments for
the advancement of religion and learning; their choice of devout and
able pastors to propagate Christianity; their caution in stocking their
provinces with people of sober lives and conversations from this the
mother kingdom; their strict regard to the distribution of justice, in
supplying the civil administration through all their colonies with
officers of the greatest abilities, utter strangers to corruption; and,
to crown all, by sending the most vigilant and virtuous governors, who
have no other views than the happiness of the people over whom they
preside, and the honour of the king their master.

But as those countries which I have described do not appear to have any
desire of being conquered and enslaved, murdered or driven out by
colonies, nor abound either in gold, silver, sugar, or tobacco, I did
humbly conceive, they were by no means proper objects of our zeal, our
valour, or our interest. However, if those whom it more concerns think
fit to be of another opinion, I am ready to depose, when I shall be
lawfully called, that no European did ever visit those countries before
me. I mean, if the inhabitants ought to be believed, unless a dispute
may arise concerning the two _Yahoos_, said to have been seen many
years ago upon a mountain in _Houyhnhnmland_, from whence the opinion
is, that the race of those brutes hath descended; and these, for
anything I know, may have been English, which indeed I was apt to
suspect from the lineaments of their posterity’s countenances, although
very much defaced. But, how far that will go to make out a title, I
leave to the learned in colony-law.

But, as to the formality of taking possession in my sovereign’s name,
it never came once into my thoughts; and if it had, yet, as my affairs
then stood, I should perhaps, in point of prudence and
self-preservation, have put it off to a better opportunity.

Having thus answered the only objection that can ever be raised against
me as a traveller, I here take a final leave of all my courteous
readers, and return to enjoy my own speculations in my little garden at
Redriff; to apply those excellent lessons of virtue which I learned
among the _Houyhnhnms_; to instruct the _Yahoos_ of my own family, as
far as I shall find them docible animals; to behold my figure often in
a glass, and thus, if possible, habituate myself by time to tolerate
the sight of a human creature; to lament the brutality to _Houyhnhnms_
in my own country, but always treat their persons with respect, for the
sake of my noble master, his family, his friends, and the whole
_Houyhnhnm_ race, whom these of ours have the honour to resemble in all
their lineaments, however their intellectuals came to degenerate.

I began last week to permit my wife to sit at dinner with me, at the
farthest end of a long table; and to answer (but with the utmost
brevity) the few questions I asked her. Yet, the smell of a _Yahoo_
continuing very offensive, I always keep my nose well stopped with rue,
lavender, or tobacco leaves. And, although it be hard for a man late in
life to remove old habits, I am not altogether out of hopes, in some
time, to suffer a neighbour _Yahoo_ in my company, without the
apprehensions I am yet under of his teeth or his claws.

My reconcilement to the _Yahoo_-kind in general might not be so
difficult, if they would be content with those vices and follies only
which nature has entitled them to. I am not in the least provoked at
the sight of a lawyer, a pickpocket, a colonel, a fool, a lord, a
gamester, a politician, a whoremonger, a physician, an evidence, a
suborner, an attorney, a traitor, or the like; this is all according to
the due course of things: but when I behold a lump of deformity and
diseases, both in body and mind, smitten with pride, it immediately
breaks all the measures of my patience; neither shall I be ever able to
comprehend how such an animal, and such a vice, could tally together.
The wise and virtuous _Houyhnhnms_, who abound in all excellences that
can adorn a rational creature, have no name for this vice in their
language, which has no terms to express any thing that is evil, except
those whereby they describe the detestable qualities of their _Yahoos_,
among which they were not able to distinguish this of pride, for want
of thoroughly understanding human nature, as it shows itself in other
countries where that animal presides. But I, who had more experience,
could plainly observe some rudiments of it among the wild _Yahoos_.


But the _Houyhnhnms_, who live under the government of reason, are no
more proud of the good qualities they possess, than I should be for not
wanting a leg or an arm; which no man in his wits would boast of,
although he must be miserable without them. I dwell the longer upon
this subject from the desire I have to make the society of an English
_Yahoo_ by any means not insupportable; and therefore I here entreat
those who have any tincture of this absurd vice, that they will not
presume to come in my sight.
